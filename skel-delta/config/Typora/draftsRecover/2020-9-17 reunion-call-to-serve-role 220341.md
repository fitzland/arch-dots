## Bible Comments

### Understanding the Context

If you were to ask someone to identify his/her spiritual gifts, what would they say? Some individuals would be reluctant to answer because they do not know. Others may not respond to avoid the perception of boasting. (Most often, it is better to demonstrate the gifts than it is to talk about them.) We may occasionally encounter people who believe their spiritual gifts are superior to those of others.

#### The Church in Corinth

The Church in Corinth Corinth was a major land and sea trade center in southwestern Greece, sixty miles west of Athens. Corinth’s commercial standing was solid, and its reputation for immorality well-deserved. Corinthians had diverse backgrounds and embraced a variety of pagan religious options. Many Jews had resettled in Corinth. In this hotbed of business, immorality, and religiosity, Paul spent eighteen months (Acts 18:1–17), helping build the church there. Paul was in Ephesus around 55 AD when he heard about problems in the church at Corinth. 

He began a series of letters that now comprise the Books of 1 and 2 Corinthians. Immorality, an unloving spirit, legal issues between members, abuse of spiritual freedom, and jealousy were rampant. Paul addressed the problem of jealousy as it related to spiritual gifts. The ability to speak in tongues, a highly noticeable gift, was apparently coveted. For some, it served as a sign of true spirituality. Some misused the gift for self-elevation and in other inappropriate ways.

For Paul, the ability to speak in tongues was not the highest gift. If anything, it was the least. Second, misuse of the gift confused those within the church, as well as outsiders interested in the church. Third, it belied the real purpose of speaking in tongues, that of serving Christ and the church. Fourth, the jealousy that surrounded the use of this gift threatened the life of the church. 

### Interpreting the Scriptures

#### The Source of Our Gifts (12:4–6)

We sometimes think of gifts as talents or abilities we have from birth; thus, we say someone is a gifted singer, teacher, or athlete. We should be good stewards in developing and using these creative talents; however, no amount of work can take someone who is tone deaf and transform him or her into a gifted singer. Such talents, valuable as they are, were not the focus of Paul’s instruction concerning gifts, though God can enhance any gift because of our spiritual relationship with him. Spiritual gifts are endowments from God to believers based on their relationship with Jesus Christ. 

The Corinthians struggled with spiritual gifts. Some of the church members had come out of pagan religious practices where they were influenced by “mute idols” (1 Cor. 12:2). Evidently, their former practices and accompanying emotions carried over to their understanding of some spiritual gifts, especially speaking in tongues, and this became a measure for some individuals to feel superior over others in the church. 

Paul used 1 Corinthians, chapters 12–14 to help the Corinthians come to a clearer understanding regarding the nature and practice of spiritual gifts. Paul used three Greek words in these verses to describe God’s gifts to the church: *charisma* (gifts), *diakonia* (service) and *energema* (working or administration). 

> 4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord. 6 There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons.

**12:4–6**. Paul did not use the word Trinity, but he referenced the Spirit, the Lord (Jesus), and God (Father). He made clear the Lord is the origin of any authentic spiritual gift, not the product of one’s making or the result of super spirituality.

“Varieties,” in each of these verses, suggest diversity and quantity. There are many different spiritual gifts. In 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12:6–8, and Ephesians 4:1–16, Paul named some of these gifts. These are representative samples and not exhaustive lists of the gifts God gives for service.

There are other gifts. For example, our church has gifted musicians who have taken their God-given gifts and honed their skills. Every week, the members of our congregation are recipients of blessings from God through the gifts of these musicians. They offer their gifts to the glory of God and the service of the congregation.

Paul used three core words in these verses: gifts, ministries, and effects. Perhaps the first notes the source. The second refers to what they make possible. The third says something about the power or the result of the gifts. Most important is to recognize spiritual gifts come from the Lord, given for his people (the church) to do the work of the church.

#### Purpose of Gifts (12:7–11)

Within the church, every believer in Jesus Christ has some gift or gifts. The purpose of the gift is not to make us feel good about ourselves or better than others, but to use our gifts for the common good. Paul dealt with this in discussing speaking in tongues (1 Cor. 14:12). God’s purpose for all gifts involves the common good and building up the church. 

Paul mentioned nine gifts. This is not the only place in the New Testament that spiritual gifts are mentioned, and the list is not exhaustive. Other lists are recorded in Romans 12:6-8, Ephesians 4:11, and 1 Peter 4:10-11. Paul did not rank the gifts for comparison. He began with wisdom. The members of the church at Corinth did not wisely address the divisions in the church or the practice of their faith. 

If God gave them wisdom, why were they not wise? As with other gifts, God distributes them, but we must choose to practice them. We also retain immaturities and flaws as we grow wiser in our understanding and practice. We should not overly criticize the Corinthians; Paul provided the needed correction. We, too, can be spiritually obtuse from time to time. 

The nine gifts deserve individual attention, for each may describe something God has given you: wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miraculous power, prophecy, distinguishing spirits, speaking in different tongues, and interpreting tongues. Paul dealt with prophecy and tongues in chapter 14. 

> **7** But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. **8** For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; **9** to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, **10** and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another *various* kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. **11** But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.

**12:7**. The Spirit gives the gifts “for the common good.” Some of the Corinthians were misusing the gifts. They apparently wanted to make themselves look good. However, these were gifts of service to be devoted to the service of God.

We serve God by serving others. These gifts are just as important today as they were in Paul’s time. The more people know and put into service the gifts of the Spirit, the more efficient the work of the church.

**12:8–10**. Specific gifts appear in these three verses. In reading and applying the meaning of each gift, it is important to discern how they serve the common good in the church.

The phrase “word of wisdom” points to an understanding of the purpose of God in Christ. Wisdom, in Scripture, helps one know how to apply truth to life. Knowledge suggests insight and learning that helps one communicate the truth, which builds up the church. 

The faith described in verse 9 is different from saving faith. It points to faith that enables one to do extraordinary things for the Lord. Gifts of healing are what they appear to be. They were evident in Jesus’ ministry and other New Testament personalities. One doubts Paul would have considered legitimate the so-called “faith healers” we see today. Miracles were similar gifts. They, too, were messianic signs that noted the coming of the kingdom of God.

Prophecy likely refers to the effective proclamation of the gospel; less so to predicting or interpreting the future. The distinguishing of spirits references discernment, which is a gift of extraordinary usefulness given the proliferation of today’s social media.

Next, Paul introduced “various kinds of tongues” and the “interpretation of tongues.” These descriptions referred to ecstatic speech, which seemed to have value to the individual but was not helpful to the church, unless there was appropriate interpretation. Paul limited the use and usefulness of tongues in chapters 12–14. There is no convincing reason to believe or teach that this gift is a special sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit or a greater depth of spirituality.

**12:11**. This verse governs how we understand the gifts of the Spirit. First, they are from the Spirit, and because they are the Spirit’s gifts, we should use them in service to the Lord and to his church.

Second, the Spirit decides to whom the gifts go. We believe the Spirit gives a gift(s) to every believer. It is inappropriate for a believer to covet the gifts of others. Rather, each believer should use the gifts he or she has received in service to the Lord.

#### Gifts Inspire Unity (12:12–13)

Paul affirmed that the church is like a body—the body of Christ. A body has many parts that all work together to make the whole thing work as one. If one part of the body is missing, then it cannot function as intended. Further, the different parts of the body cannot be jealous of the other parts. It’s a staggering, inspirational thought but also a sobering one when we realize we sometimes do not appreciate or support the body of Christ as we should. 

Paul mentioned baptism in this passage. However, it appears, not as a reference to water baptism, but as a spiritual reference to the Spirit of God, who immerses us into the body of Christ (see also Galatians 3:26–28). When the Spirit baptizes us and brings us together, old distinctions do not matter. That was revolutionary for someone of his Jewish heritage. It was also a challenge to the Roman society that depended on slavery. Even today, we struggle with the implications of Paul’s words, for if water baptism is all that we have, we just get wet. However, if we embrace a genuine relationship with God, we have entered into the body of Christ by the Holy Spirit. We share and embrace a new humanity, although we may still struggle with the implications of 1 Corinthians 12:13. 

> 12 For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.

**12:12**. A body is not merely a set of parts; it is a whole. What affects any part of the body impacts the whole. Different body parts have different functions. In verse 14 and following, Paul illustrated this via the picture of the
human body.

**12:13**. In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul asked, “Has Christ been divided?” The implied answer was, “Of course not.” When an individual becomes a believer, the Spirit makes one a part of the body. Paul may have alluded to the universal church, but that church finds expression in the work and makeup of the local church. The Spirit draws people to Christ, and as we receive the Spirit (drink of one Spirit), he makes us a part of Christ’s body.

The unity of the body in serving the purpose of Christ is evident. The spiritual gifts serve the purpose of the body.

#### Example of Gifts and their Administration (12:27–31)

The early church depended on apostolic leaders, those who had actually seen Jesus (see Acts 1:22). They were foundational to the church. With limited travel and communication (compared to today), the apostles needed help. They eventually died. That led to other leaders, as well as written materials that today we call the Bible. Again, the list is not exclusive, for later Paul would write about the pastor, teacher, and evangelist (Ephesians 4:11). Though we still recognize the roles of pastors, other church ministers, theological teachers, denominational workers, and many others, the “helpers” noun presents an open door of opportunity for most all of us. 

In the body of Christ, everyone matters; everyone has gifts. It is not about who is on stage or who is most gifted; it is about everyone working together. Paul asked rhetorical questions, which his readers could easily answer. We are not the same; we have different roles, gifts, and ways of serving God. Paul tried to help the Corinthians understand spiritual gifts, and then he pointed them to what he called “the most excellent way,” the way of love. 

Evidently, the Corinthians had not been practicing this love, and it still challenges Christians today. The translation of 12:31 is interesting, for it offers two ways of translating the Greek words, both of which are permissible. One way translates the first phrase as a command. An alternative is to translate the words as a statement, “But you have eagerly desired the greater gifts, and now I will show you the most excellent way.” That translation reflects the Corinthian problem, seeking recognition and claiming superiority over other Christians. Rather than argue over gifts, Paul’s directive was to embody the love of God in Christ. 

> 27 Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues. 29 All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they? 30 All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?
>
> 31 But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way.

**12:27–28**. As a believer and local church member, I am part of the body of Christ. When we have received gift(s) from the Spirit, we use those gifts in service to the body. We also realize God intends to guide the individuals who are gifted in the various areas of service.
Churches are, to a greater and lesser extent, adept at helping people discover their gifts and serve in areas appropriate to those gifts. It is a pursuit the church would do well to continue and to improve.

**12:29–30**. The Spirit is the giver of the gifts; it is the Spirit’s prerogative to give the gifts to whom he will. Paul also said, “you (presumably the church) are not lacking in any gift,” (1 Cor. 1:7). Therefore, in the church, all of us who are part of that one body have a different gift(s) from the Spirit to offer in service to the Lord and his church.

**12:31**. To “earnestly desire the greater gifts” does not mean to be jealous of others or covet their gifts. It means to have an earnest desire to possess and use the gifts that are of greatest service to the church. The conclusion of this verse is a transition to Paul’s exposition of how the gifts are used, and how the body functions in the greatest way—through love.

### Focusing on the Meaning

Profound theology emanates from Paul’s letter to the most troubled of churches—the church at Corinth. Early in the letter, Paul identified divisions that wracked the church: jealousy, strife, and a party spirit. Later, he identified grave immorality in the church. He was openly critical of their ungenerous and unloving spirits in dealing with one another.

The church at Corinth was torn from within. Selfishness, sin, jealousy, and division all threatened its existence. Of all things, even the spiritual gifts were a source of conflict. Paul sought to correct this conflict in two ways that are relevant to the contemporary church. First, he reminded the Corinthian church that spiritual gifts were gifts. The people neither earned nor deserved them. And, just as some components of the human body are more visually presentable, the hidden parts are equally, if not more, important to the welfare of the individual.

Second, Paul showed the gifts are given for the good of the church and in service to the Lord. The gifts believers have received from the Spirit are to serve others—not to elevate themselves or their empires. A wise pastor once told me, “The church is bigger than one person.” He meant the church is not all about the pastor or any one person; it belongs to Jesus. When we render active, focused service through the church, we are serving the Lord.

Perhaps the litmus test for churches is to consider how to help people know, understand, and apply the gifts of God. The Lord wants more than warm bodies in places of service. He wants people who are willing, who are gifted by his Spirit, and who care.

## Teaching Plans

### DISCOVERY PLAN

#### Connect with Life

1. Before class time, place a one-dollar bill inside a box. In a different sized box, enclose a five-dollar bill. Put a ten-dollar bill in a third box. Wrap each box in different paper. As class members enter the room, encourage them to participate in a silent auction by writing down on a bid sheet (previously created), how much they would pay for the content of each gift. To encourage everyone to bid on at least one item, explain that the proceeds from the bidding will go to a mission’s fund. After the bidding concludes, award the three highest bidders their gifts. 

   Ask auction participants, Why did you bid on a particular gift? Ask the auction winners, How did you feel when you won the bid for your gift? How did you feel when you opened your gift? Ask the others, How did it feel when you didn’t win the item you wanted? Say, God has given every believer at least one spiritual gift to be used to build up the body of Christ. 

  #### Guide Bible Study

2. Group class members into two debate teams. Assign the “Pro-team” this argument: God can use an individual in an area of service in the local church even if he or she does not have the spiritual gift for that field. Assign the “Con-team” this argument: God cannot use an individual in an area of service in the local church if they do not have the spiritual gift associated with that area. Allow the teams time to prepare their cases, then give each side two minutes to state
    their case and one minute to rebut the other team’s arguments. After the debate, work with the class to identify key truths about spiritual gifts.

3. Keep the class in two groups. Assign group one 1 Corinthians 12:4–6. Assign group two 1 Corinthians 12:7–11. As the Bible study leader, take 1 Corinthians 12:12–13, 27–31. Direct each group to write a brief news report on the content of their section and assigned Scripture. After a few minutes, recruit someone from each team to read their news report to the class.

4. Point out that, along with 1 Corinthians 12:4–13, 27–31, two other passages of Scripture address spiritual gifts, Romans 12:3–8 and Ephesians 4:11–13. Direct the teams to read the passages of Scripture and write the designated gifts on provided index cards (one gift per card). Play a game of charades using the gifts listed on the cards. Alternate teams between acting and guessing the gift being portrayed.  

  #### Encourage Application

5. Before the session, develop a written list of five groups of “Would You Rather?” questions that relate to the practice of spiritual gifts. Try to develop questions that represent as many different spiritual gifts as possible or ones that highlight ministries in your church. (Examples: Would you rather speak to a large audience or teach a small group Bible study? Would you rather direct a backyard Bible club on an international mission trip or serve homeless families at a nearby soup kitchen?) Give each class member a copy of the “Would You Rather” questions. Ask volunteers to explain the reasoning behind their choices. 

   Say, God often equips people with a passion for their giftedness. Challenge each class member to develop a list of his or her top-three possible spiritual gifts. Encourage everyone to look for opportunities to practice their gifts and support the spiritual gifts of others.

  ### DISCUSSION PLAN

  #### Connect with Life

Before the session begins, choose several sports (or organizations) that require teamwork and list their respective team positions (or jobs) on the whiteboard. After class members arrive, direct them to identify the essential responsibilities of each role listed to contribute to team success. Say, Each of us has responsibilities and assignments to help ensure the body of Christ is functioning well.

#### Guide Bible Study

Before class time, recruit a person to research the ancient city of Corinth and the New Testament church at Corinth, emphasizing the issue of spiritual gifts in the Corinthian church. Say, The church in Corinth was not living up to its full potential; it was divided in many ways and needed to unify to impact the region for Christ.

Before class time, write the following scrambled words on the whiteboard.

TGIFS (Greek word charisma) = GIFTS

VRIECSE (Greek word diakonia) = SERVICE

GWKIONR (Greek word energema) = WORKING

Ask someone to read 1 Corinthians 12:4–6 aloud. Encourage class members to unscramble the three terms you wrote on the board, terms Paul used to describe what God has given to his church. Briefly define each of these terms, noting that we get the English words charismatic, deacon, and energy from the Greek terms. Say, God gives these gifts to believers according to his divine sovereignty.

Enlist a volunteer to read 1 Corinthians 12:7–11 aloud. Direct class members to identify and describe the manifestations of the Spirit (12:7) and the wide variety of gifts listed in the passage (12:8–10). Say, This list was not intended to be  exhaustive. Paul was communicating that God gives every believer at least one spiritual gift for the common good of the church.

Recruit another volunteer to read 1 Corinthians 12:12–13, 27–31 aloud. Ask class members, Why did Paul use the imagery of a physical body to illustrate his point? What did Paul mean when he used the word “ baptized”? Utilize Study Guide content to guide the discussion.

Post the following four principles about spiritual gifts:

- Universality—Every believer has at least one spiritual gift. No one is the exception.
- Humility—No believer has every spiritual gift. No Christian is “omni-gifted.”
- Diversity—Believers have different spiritual gifts from one another. We are all unique.
- Sovereignty—Believers receive spiritual gifts according to the sovereign will of Christ’s Spirit. God distributes gifts according to his wisdom.

Encourage volunteers to share their thoughts on each of the four principles.

####   Encourage Application

Ask, Can you identify the spiritual gifts of our church staff? 

Study the Scriptures about gifts and see if anything fits you.

Do not wait until you have everything figured out. Start serving God and others, and see if you then recognize your giftedness.

What have others said about you that suggests potential gifts?

Look at what you do well, and ask God to guide you to use if for his purposes.
