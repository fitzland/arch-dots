## Introduction

An effective witness is like a signpost. It doesn’t matter whether the sign is old or new, it has to be understandable and it has to point people in the right direction. As Christians, we are witnesses to Jesus Christ. Our communication of the gospel must also be clear as we point the world to Jesus. When was the last time you pointed someone to Christ?

### Bible Passages

> 8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, 9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus *as* Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 10 for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in Him will not be disappointed.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same *Lord* is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; 13 for “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

> 14 How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 15 How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things!”

> 1 Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
>
> 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; 7 then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles; 8 and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also.

## Commentary

### Understanding the Context

In this lesson we, we come to a subject that a number of believers would rather avoid, if not in principle at least in practice—witnessing. Truth be told, the idea of (verbally) sharing their faith with unbelievers causes many erstwhile disciples to feel uncertainty, insecurity, and anxiety. At the same time, however, deep down inside, those who love and laud Jesus as Lord and Savior want to offer a winsome witness with their words and their ways, their lives and their lips.

How can we work our way through this spiritual nettle? One important piece to this sometimes-confounding puzzle is to continue to allow the Bible to shape our cognitions and affections. Today’s lesson features two Pauline passages regarding the gospel. The first, Romans 10:8–15,
focuses upon the necessity of both proclaiming and believing in the
gospel. The second, 1 Corinthians 15:1–8, emphasizes the crux of the
gospel message, namely, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.
Romans 10:8–15, a key component of the so-called “Roman Road to
Salvation” (see Rom. 3:10–12, 23; 6:23; 5:8; 10:9–10, 13; 5:1; 8:1, 38–39), is
a part of Paul’s protracted, anguished reflection in Romans 9—11 upon
the reluctance of so many of his fellow Jews to confess and embrace
Jesus as Lord. Although Gentiles (that is, non-Jews) were more receptive
to the gospel the Apostle Paul proclaimed, 1 Corinthians 15 indicates
that the message he preached was not necessarily the word his primar-
ily Gentile converts received. Indeed, Paul’s rehearsal of the gospel he
declared in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 15:1–8 was occasioned by the
claim of certain persons within the church that there was no such thing
as resurrection from the dead (see 1 Cor. 15:12). We now turn to treat
these texts in turn.

### Faith vs. the Law (Romans 10:8)

The law Israel received from God through Moses provided instruction for daily living. It also gave them a way to exercise righteousness before God. The law outlined everything they needed to know regarding worship and the holiness of God. However, the law was only a shadow of the revelation of the righteousness that is received by faith (as opposed to works) in Jesus Christ.

The comparison between faith and the law was what the apostle Paul sought to share with the Romans. Both the  similarities and distinctions between the law given by Moses in the Old Testament, and the gospel of Jesus Christ in the New Testament, are made clear in this chapter. The justification Paul describes cannot be obtained by works or deeds, but by faith alone. Paul explained that the law brought blessings as a reward for the people’s obedience to God, as well as curses if they disobeyed and turned away from him. We no longer have a list of laws to obey, but an opportunity to be completely justified before God and declared righteous by placing our faith and trust in Christ (Galatians 2:16).

In verse 8, Paul made a reference to Deuteronomy 30:14. He explained that Jesus is the “word of faith” that has fulfilled the law of Moses. Just as Moses and the children of Israel were required to love the Lord their God and keep his commandments in order to inherit blessings (Deut. 30:19–20), we must make a confession of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
and believe in our heart in order to inherit eternal life.

Paul pressed upon his Roman audience that, “the word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart” describing its closeness and availability. Paul went on to explain that it is as near and available now as it was in the Old Testament. Just as the children of Israel would publically express their belief and love for God through obedience to the law, we must now make a verbal confession of faith in Christ and believe in him with our hearts in order to receive life.

### The Proper Response to the Gospel (10:9–10)

Witnessing to the world and sharing our faith in Jesus Christ is one of the most important duties of Christians. When we seek to share the message of salvation in Jesus Christ, it is important that we communicate clearly what is needed for someone to authentically receive the gospel.

Placing one’s faith in Christ is a personal decision, but it does require an open confession with the mouth. Paul used the term “confess” in verse 9 which means “to say the same thing”. This refers to the gospel message that Jesus Christ was crucified, that God raised him from the grave, and that he is Lord.

Paul also said in verse 10 that, “it is with the heart that you believe and are justified.” The word translated “justified” in the Greek language means “to be made right with God.” The two steps are simple and clear. One must confess with their mouth and believe in their heart in order to be saved. Believing in the heart is more than simply making an intellectual response to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Greek word translated “believe” literally means “to be fully persuaded.” Your clear and faithful witness and the convicting power of the Holy Spirit can work in tandem to bring about a sincere confession of faith in Christ.

The result of sincere confession and belief is that a person is “saved.” They are rescued from the penalty of sin. They are saved from something (eternal separation from God), and they are saved for something (serving God through a growing relationship with Jesus Christ.)

### The Gospel is Trustworthy (10:11)

We live in a world where terms such as assurance, guarantee, proof, and reliability are significant when we decide to place our trust in something or someone. Paul assured the Romans that anyone who put their trust in God would not be put to shame. Because it is written in God’s word, it is true. Paul referenced the prophecy found in Isaiah 28:16 concerning the surety of souls who put their trust and belief in God. Isaiah refers to Jesus Christ as the “tested stone” or the “precious cornerstone” who would prove to be a sure foundation for anyone who places their trust in him.

### Case Study

Victoria is a young, single mother in a local church. She attends church services sparingly. Though her manner of  appearance is often provocative, her demeanor is usually quiet and reserved. Often times during the services she cries during the sermon but afterwards she’s silent. Victoria is not a member of the church she attends.

Just before the invitation at the close of the worship service, when the pastor invites unbelievers to faith in Christ, she conveniently walks out of the service. She returns a week or two later and repeats the same pattern of behavior. This Sunday Victoria takes a seat next to you in the sanctuary. Are you willing to extend yourself toward Victoria today, or will you watch her exit the sanctuary? Would you be willing to set up a breakfast or lunch meeting with her to become better acquainted? What could you do to build a relationship with her that would lead to sharing the gospel?

### The Gospel is for Everyone (10:12–13)

Who can be saved? When Paul mentioned in verse 12 that, “there is no difference between Jew and Gentile,” he was saying that the gospel is accessible to all of humanity. We are all guilty of sin because of our sin nature (Rom. 3:23). Paul taught that witnessing to sinners requires letting them know that regardless of who they are or what they’ve done, God’s love and salvation are available to anyone who will receive it. 

Paul assured the Romans that God is impartial with those who call on him. While we may make distinctions between people based on a diversity of cultures and ethnicities, Paul made it clear that the word of salvation does not discriminate; but is available to whoever puts their trust in Jesus. This is the beauty of the gospel: there is no partiality in it. It is available to young and old, rich and poor, law breakers and law abiding citizens, educated and uneducated; whoever calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved. Paul validates this with his restatement of the prophecy of Joel 2:32. Joel stood before Israel as they faced universal judgment and destruction due to their sin and disobedience. This is the picture of God rescuing every believer who puts their trust in him from eternal destruction.

### The Gospel Should be Shared by All Christians (10:14–15)

In this section, Paul argued that since there is no partiality for those who call on the name of the Lord, then everyone has the responsibility of spreading the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ. One might say, “I don’t have a seminary education, or ministerial credentials.” However, neither of these are prerequisites for spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Paul made it clear that one cannot call upon a God he has not known or has not heard of. The same gospel message we heard and received has been given to us to spread throughout the world. It is important that we remember the process by which we were saved, which was through someone else sharing the message of the gospel with us. This challenges us to grow in our faith and to make every effort to express our faith in Christ through our daily lives.

Isaiah referred to the honor that is associated with those who carry the message of the gospel as ones having “beautiful feet” (Isaiah 52:7), and Paul quoted Isaiah in Romans 10:15. During Paul’s time, people who proclaimed good news were called “heralds.” A herald was someone who ran through town announcing (with a loud voice) the latest, most important news. Just like those heralds, we have been given the responsibility and authority to share the message of the gospel wherever we go.

### The Gospel Should be Shared in its Entirety (1 Corinthians 15:1–2)

Is the resurrection of the body literal or spiritual? In this chapter Paul addressed the need for the church at Corinth to return or to “hold firm” to their foundational beliefs concerning the gospel he had preached to them. False teaching had begun to creep into the church as a result of the influence of Greek culture, human philosophy, and a spirit of skepticism. These influences created doubt regarding the validity of the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. This issue presented some serious problems. The formation of sects and philosophical groups within the church had caused the believers to begin to question one of the foundational tenets of the Christian faith. It’s interesting how a slight variation
of the message of the gospel can be the difference between someone believing or rejecting its claims.

In verses 1–2, Paul does not seek to introduce a new teaching to challenge the skepticism concerning the bodily  resurrection of Jesus. Instead, he exhorts his readers to “hold firmly” to the gospel he had preached to them so they would not be confused. In spite of the philosophical debates concerning the specifics of the gospel, he encouraged
the Corinthians to focus on the foundational principles of the faith.

### The Basics of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (15:3–8)

Paul provides a four point outline of the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He began by reminding his readers that the gospel message he preached to them was the same message he received from Jesus (Galatians 1:12). He then outlines the gospel: 1) Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures (Psalm 16:10; Isaiah 53:8–10). While skeptics asserted that the resurrection never happened 4, Paul argues in verse 4 that 2) Christ was buried, which verified an authentic death. It is so important for us as disciples to know what we believe and why. As we share our faith in Jesus Christ we must be convinced that the message of the gospel is true and that it contains the power to change lives. 3) Jesus was raised on the third day (a bodily resurrection), and 4) Jesus appeared to Peter first, then to the twelve, and then to  numerous others including Paul; all according to the Scripture.

There were eyewitnesses to the fact that Christ had indeed died, was buried, and was resurrected by God for the sins of the world. After his resurrection, Jesus appeared to more than five hundred witnesses. The words of Paul prove that the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is true and had proven to be life-transforming for those who believed. Our commission as disciples is to proclaim our faith as we share the facts of the gospel (Matthew 28:18–20).

No event in history compares to the resurrection of Christ. The mention of Jesus’ appearance to Peter, then to the twelve, and then to more than five hundred of the disciples at the same time proved to be verifiable facts for those who doubted Paul’s words. Paul stated that many of the people who witnessed these things were still living. This meant they were able to bear witness to the resurrection. These post-resurrection appearances are direct evidence that Christ did indeed die, was buried, and was raised from the dead for our sins.

## Application

Witnessing to those who need God’s gift of salvation is vital for the world we live in. The gospel has the power to change lives forever. Paul provides for us the message and the motivation needed to be all that God has called us to be as disciples of Jesus Christ. The message Paul shared with the Roman Christians was that by faith in Christ we can be saved
from sin and condemnation. Paul speaks clearly that the saving word of God is near and available to us.

The word of God has been fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. It has the power to change the life of anyone who puts their trust in him. The gospel is available to anyone who desires to receive it regardless of age, race, creed, color, sex, culture, economic status, or past failures. Therefore it is incumbent upon us as Christian disciples to witness to those who have not been exposed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. God himself has given us the authority and the means to impact the world with the love of Christ. Are you willing to commit to daily sharing the message of Jesus Christ with those you encounter?
