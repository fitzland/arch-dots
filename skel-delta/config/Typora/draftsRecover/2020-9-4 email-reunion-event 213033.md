I know you have questions about our upcoming Reunion event. 

This email is intended to answer your questions, and I've also posted some information on the [website](https://fbccana.org/2020/09/04/reunion/). That post will be updated with additional information in the coming weeks, but I'll give you a summary. 

If you still have questions, please feel free to call or email.

### What is this Reunion event?

Itâ€™s a chance to start over. How many times in our lives can we truly start over? Rarely does it happen, but with COVID, we have this unique chance to do that within our church. 

### When will the Reunion event start?

You've probably already heard. We will kick things off on Sunday, September 13. Come join us as we take a journey to discover who a Christian is and what a church is meant to be!

### What will the Reunion event involve?

It will include a six-sermon preaching series (all the ministers will be involved), six connected Bible studies (each class will be teaching the same lesson each week), several service projects (you can sign-up to help on Sunday mornings), a prayer march, and a church-wide effort to start over as a church.

### Where will my class meet on Sunday, September 13?

Sorry for the confusion. I've been working with our custodial staff to figure out the best configurations. As it turns out, most of us will be meeting in our usual location. To maintain social distancing, there will be a few exceptions. NOTE: On Sunday morning, I would love for you to take a peek in your room. Give me some feedback. If you think it will work, then great! If you think we need to make some adjustments, I'm happy to accomodate.

### How and when will I get my Bible study lessons?

The first two lessons are attached to this email, but if you have trouble opening them, I'll have additional print copies in the Church Office.

### Is it safe to meet again for Bible study?

Only God knows, but just as we have been taking precautions in our worship services, we will also take precautions in our Bible study classes to mitigate the risk of a COVID spread. You'll be able to see our recommended guidelines on the website mentioned above.

I'm sure I've overlooked some things, but I know you'll remind me.

Your Buddy,
