# Romans 1.1-17

## Introduction and Theme

### Opening Statements

**Life-Changing**. The letter to the Romans is a book that repeatedly changes the world, by changing people. 

- Augustine was converted in A.D. 386 reading [Romans 13.13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13.13-14&version=CEV).
- Martin Luther’s understanding of salvation was radically changed in A.D. 1513 as he compared [Psalm 31.1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+31.1&version=CEV) to [Romans 1.17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1.17&version=CEV).
- John Wesley was converted in A.D. 1738 after hearing Luther’s sermon on the introduction to Romans being read because the assigned preacher did not show up!

### Recipients

**Destination**. Rome. We do not know who founded the church at Rome:

- People who were visiting Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and were converted and returned home to start a church (cf. [Acts 2.10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2.10&version=CEV)).
- Disciples who fled the persecution in Jerusalem after the death of Stephen (cf. [Acts 8.4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8.4&version=CEV)).
- Converts from Paul’s missionary journeys who traveled to Rome. Paul had never visited this church, but he longed to (cf. [Acts 19.21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+19.21&version=CEV)). He had many friends there (cf. Romans 16).

**Letter Carrier**. Phoebe, who was traveling in that direction, carried the letter from Paul to Rome (cf. [Romans 16.1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16.1&version=CEV)). 

### Historical Setting 

- **3rd Journey**. Paul is coming to the end of his third missionary journey. He spent most of his time (3 years) in the city of Ephesus in modern-day Turkey. After concluding his ministry in Ephesus, Paul headed to Jerusalem by way of Macedonia and Achaia (the two Roman provinces which today make up Greece).  

- **Relief**. On this leg of his missionary journey he collected a relief offering for the poverty-stricken saints in Jerusalem (cf. [Romans 15.25-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15.25-26&version=CEV)). Paul’s ministry to the Gentiles had created a real division between the Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul desired that the relief offering from the Gentile Christians mend the break in their relationship with the Jewish Christians and create real unity between them.  

- **Place of Writing**. On his way to Jerusalem Paul remained three months in the province of Achaia ([Acts 20.1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20.1-3&version=CEV)) whose capital was Corinth where Paul had conducted the bulk of his second missionary journey. From there he most likely wrote Romans.  

### Purpose 

- **Desire for Spain**. Paul for all practical purposes has evangelized the eastern realm of the Roman empire, all the way from Jerusalem to the western shores of Greece ([Romans 15.19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15.19&version=CEV)). Having no desire to preach the gospel in regions where it had already been preached, Paul desires to take the gospel to the westernmost reaches of the Roman empire, to Spain ([15.24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15.24&version=CEV)).  

- **Church Sponsor**. At the beginning of his missionary journeys, the city of Antioch in Syria served as the sponsoring church. This church most likely supported him not only in prayer but also financially. Later Ephesus served as the sponsoring church for his evangelistic efforts in Asia Minor. Paul though now wants to evangelize Spain which is too far for the Ephesian and Antiochene churches to sponsor. He needs a new sponsoring church.  

- **Gospel Understanding**. To address the problem in the Roman church between believing Jews and believing Gentiles. This was probably a result of the expulsion of all Jews from Rome and their later return. Jewish Christian leaders had been replaced by Gentile Christian leaders. What was at stake here was not the unity of the church but the message that Jesus Christ is Lord of the universe.  

- Paul deals with this issue at length in [Romans 15.7-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15.7-12&version=CEV). It also is the major issue behind Romans 9-11 in which Paul has to answer the question why Jews on a large scale rejected Jesus as the Messiah of the Jews.  

### Structure of the Text

The introduction is composed of three segments. Greeting (1.1-7), which identifies both the writer and the recipients, and their relationship. Thanksgiving (1.8-13) in which Paul shares his prayers and plans concerning them. Theme (1.14-17), which is the key to Paul’s motivation and his ministry.

#### Greeting (1.1-7)

This is the longest greeting of any of his epistles. More typical greetings…

> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace (1 Thessalonians 1:1).

> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope; to Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord (1 Timothy 1:1-2).

Most of the greeting in Paul’s other epistles begin and end in a similar way. In Romans, Paul gives a synopsis of the gospel. 

*Why would Paul give a synopsis of the gospel here, in the introduction?*

To establish trust. Paul that they both share and believe in the same gospel. 

**Caution**. Satan deceives the saints and corrupts the church by sending his “false apostles” as “angels of light” (2 Corinthians 11:12-15). Paul tell us to be on guard for such false apostles. We should know what gospel men preach, before we heed their teaching.

> 1 Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, 2 which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, 

**bond-servant**. slave or servant; often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. For someone who was Jewish this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege.

**apostle**. sent one. This is not a job Paul selected himself for, or even applied for. He was called into it—he was commissioned and taught directly by the risen Jesus himself (cf. Acts 9.1-19). 

**set apart**. separated; to be moved away and apart from everything else. Paul was set apart to spread the gospel. Paul is willing to separate himself from anything—wealth, health, acclaim, friends, safety—in order to be faithful to his calling.

**gospel**. good herald or message; good news; an announcement—a declaration. In the first century, if a on a far-flung battlefield an emperor won a great victory which secured his peace and established his authority, he would send heralds to declare his victory. 

It is a good message, not a bad message or a neutral message but a good message. Some people treat it like it was bad news because they don't want to hear about the gospel. Whereas the gospel assumes there is bad news out there (we're in trouble spiritually unless God intervenes), it is essentially good news because in Jesus Christ God has intervened on our behalf.

**of God**. the gospel which God brings or the gospel about God. It did not originate with Paul and he did not claim the authority to craft it. We are not at liberty to reshape it to sound more appealing in our day, not to domesticate it to be more comfortable for our lives.

**promised beforehand**. the gospel is not new; the prophets and holy scriptures point forward to this announcement. Numerous passages foreshadowed or foretold the Messiah’s coming to save people from their sins. The gospel was God’s plan from the start.

> 3 concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh, 4 who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord, 

**His Son**. The savior is none other than God the son, the second Person of the trinity. Jesus was (and is) the Savior in God’s plan. This points to His divine nature. The name **Jesus** points to his humanity; He came to earth in human flesh, was born of a virgin mother, and was given the name that means “the Lord saves.” The title **Christ** is the Greek form of the Hebrew word Messiah, meaning “anointed one.” The term **Lord** point to Jesus’ sovereign reign over the church and the lives of His subjects.

**descendant of David**. the Hebrew Scriptures revealed the Messiah would be born into King David’s royal lineage (cf. 2 Samuel 7.12-16; Psalm 132.11; Isaiah 11.1-10).

**according to the flesh**. He was human like all of us.

**declared**. better translation than appointed; there was not a time when Jesus was not the Son of God. Two great realities served to confirm His eternal deity.

**resurrection**. undeniable evidence of his power over life and death. It makes possible the glorious hope of the believer’s resurrection to eternal life (cf. John 11.25; 1 Corinthians 15.12-13, 20-23). The reality of the resurrection lent power to the gospel the apostles preached.

**Spirit of holiness**. the Spirit permeated Jesus’ love in the flesh; emphasis on the uniquely holiness Jesus demonstrated from His humble birth to His death on the cross.

> 5 through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name’s sake, 

**we have received**. He received grace and apostleship as undeserved gifts. The Lord did not leave Paul under judgment related to his former persecution of Christ’s followers. Christ saved Paul by graciously forgiving him of his sins and giving him a new life. His apostolic ministry was not the result of either personal merit or effort. Christ gave Paul a mission.

**grace and apostleship**.

**obedience of faith**. salvation in which obedience comes from faith; a radical transformation from his background as a Pharisee, in which he taught that salvation required obedience to the Law. Salvation in Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law perfectly and answered it’s demand for a sin offering once and for all (cf. 2 Corinthians 5.20-21; Hebrews 10.8-15).

> 6 among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ; 7 to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**called of Jesus**. Christ takes the initiative both in salvation and in Christian service. 

**beloved of God in Rome**.  although believers were often looked down on and sometimes persecuted, they were loved by God. believers comprising the multiple house-churches in Rome.

**called as saints**. holy ones. set apart as God’s redeemed people.

#### Thanksgiving (1.8-13)

> 8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world. 9 For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of His Son, is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you, 10 always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you. 11 For I long to see you in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established; 12 that is, that I may be encouraged together with you while among you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine. 13 And I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented thus far) in order that I might obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.

Paul had been a believer and an apostle for a number of years. Approximately ten years earlier Paul and Barnabas were “set apart” for “the work to which God had called them” (see Acts 13.2). He had never before visited or written the saints at Rome. 

*Why should the Roman believers listen to him? What did Paul know about them?* 

**Prayers**. Paul’s interest and involvement in the church at Rome can be seen in his prayers for them. His prayers include praise and thanksgiving for this church in Rome. He knows a great deal about this body of believers, even though he has not yet been to Rome. Paul has kept track of this church, of its witness, and of its progress. 

**Visit**. Paul had, for some time, been eager to visit Rome and to spend some time with them. While he persisted in trying to get to Rome, he was consistently prevented from doing so. He looked forward to his visit as an occasion for mutual ministry, one to another. If Paul’s absence suggested to any that he did not care much about the believers at Rome, Paul’s petitions and his plans indicate otherwise. If he could have visited Rome before this, he would have.

**Ministry**. In Paul’s absence, he found at least two ways to minister to the brothers at Rome. The first was to pray for them, as he prayed for all the churches (for example, Ephesians 1.15-19a; 3.14-19; Philippians 1.3-5; Colossians 1.9-12). The second was to write them an epistle, in which he would convey those truths which he wished to teach in person and which he had taught the churches where he had ministered in person. Paul’s letter was the most personal ministry he could provide at the moment. It was the outgrowth of his love, interest and concern them.

**Caring**. The believers in Rome could listen to Paul because he was an apostle, an apostle whose ministry was to all the Gentiles. But they would listen to Paul because he was a man who cared much for them, who had (unknown to them) invested heavily in their faith and ministry. He was a man with a heart for God and for God’s people. 

> 14 I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. 15 Thus, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.

**under obligation**. The gospel made him a debtor, a debtor to the Gentiles through the grace of God. Those who seek righteousness through works will try to get ahead, to have a “positive balance” of righteousness on account with God. But, the righteousness of God, obtained by faith, places one in eternal debt. The righteousness which we receive by faith is that which we do not deserve. We are, and eternally continue to be, debtors to God’s grace.

**wise & foolish**. Paul placed no artificial limits on the groups he pursued with the gospel. Paul realized that when it came to humanity’s universal need, all are the same. There is no first class and second class.

**I am eager**. debt of grace was no duty; rather debt of love. If we are indebted to love others (Romans 13:8), we are first indebted to love God. Paul looked upon himself as a debtor, a debtor to God, and a debtor to all men. His eagerness to minister to the Romans was the result of God’s grace, an overflow of the grace which had saved him.

*Why share the gospel with believers in Rome?*

**who are in Rome**. God warned the Israelites that they would tend to forget God’s deliverance and, in the process, would forget that it was by His grace and not due to their own goodness or works that His blessings had been poured out upon them (see Deuteronomy 8:11-20). We tend to forget that God’s blessings come as a result of His grace, and thus we need to be reminded. This is why we, as a church, remember His death on a regular, weekly basis (see Acts 2:42, 46; 20:7; 1 Corinthians 11:17-34).

#### Theme (1.16-17)

> 16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 

**not ashamed**. Paul’s desire was to be clear, simple, and bold (see 1 Corinthians 2:1-5; Ephesians 6:18-20; 2 Thessalonians 3:1-2). If the gospel is, itself, mighty to save, the power of God resulting in salvation, then we need but to proclaim it, in simplicity, in purity, and in dependence upon God, who will by His Word save men.

**power of God**. power of the cross. Having created human beings with the ability to choose either obedience or sin, could He save them after they chose sin? YES—by the cost of Jesus’ death on the cross.

**to everyone**. it is available to everyone; no one is to far gone.

**who believes**. Salvation is wher God’s power to forgive and restore meets the sinner’s humble repentance and faith.

> 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “But the righteous man shall live by faith.”

**righteousness of God**. The application of the gospel involves far more than just repentance and faith, leading to salvation. The gospel provides both the motivation and the means for our sanctification, as well as our salvation. The gospel is not only the message by which we enter into salvation; it is the motivation and the means by which our salvation is lived out. The gospel is a part of God’s eternal plan and purpose, which is still being worked out.

**Quality**. Normally when we think of righteousness, we think of something that a person possesses, like goodness or honesty. We use it to describe God’s character, that is, He is righteous or that He possesses righteousness. 

**New Concept**. Paul, on the other hand, introduces a new concept in Galatians and Romans which built upon the belief that God is righteous. According to Paul because God is righteous, He acts righteously, or to be more precise, because God is righteous, He makes people right with Himself, with others, and with themselves. [When we speak about God’s righteousness, we’re not talking about morality in general. Whereas God’s righteousness is moral, not all morality is God’s righteousness. Otherwise, the Pharisees would have attained to God’s righteousness. We are talking about the kind of life God Himself lives and which only He can produce. (See Rom. 12:1-15:13 for a description of that righteousness.)]

**faith to faith**. The expression “from faith to faith” is interesting and important. Faith has its origin, but it also has its outworkings. The Christian life begins with saving faith, and it initiates a life which is characterized by an ever-growing faith. Faith is the means by which men are saved, it is also the means by which saved men live, and it is the outworking of men’s faith.

**live by faith**. [ETB] We become righteous not by meeting the demands of the law but by believing in Jesus—a focus on the contrast between works and belief—INCOMPLETE.

Some background. Paul cites from Habakkuk 2.4. Habakkuk had protested to God that Judah was corrupt, that God’s Law was ignored, and that justice was swallowed up by violence and wickedness (Habakkuk 1.1-4). He asked God why He had not come to save His people (1:2).

God responded, not in the way Habakkuk expected (1:5-11). He would chasten His people with a strong and cruel people—the Chaldeans. They would sweep down on Judah and take these rebellious people into captivity. In addition, the cruelty and sin of the Chaldeans would not be overlooked, for God would punish this people for their pride and arrogance (1:11).

Habakkuk could not understand how God could use wicked men to achieve His purposes. The Chaldeans, in his mind, were even more wicked than the people of Judah (1:12-17). 

God was telling Habakkuk that he would have to live his life, day by day, by faith. He might not see the day of Israel’s restoration and blessing, but by faith he must believe God’s promises would be fulfilled. 

### Conclusion

As I conclude, let me summarize some of these for your consideration and further study.

**Paul sought to conform his life to his calling**. As the basis for his ministry, the very first thing to which Paul referred to was his divine calling as an “apostle” and his being “set apart” for a ministry of the gospel to the Gentiles. Paul was absolutely convinced that he was called to the work which he was doing.

**Paul’s motivation and basis for ministry was a healthy view of God and His purposes**. Paul was not caught up by his own worth, but in his work. He was not thinking in terms of his status (bondslaves have no status), but in terms of his service to the Lord and to others. Paul did not think in terms of his credits, but in terms of his indebtedness. Paul’s life was not self-absorbed, but dominated by the gospel. Paul’s life was in Christ. 

**Paul’s words and actions** **display the sovereign providence of God**. Paul had a clear sense of the purposes of God but not of the details of God’s plan. Paul was convinced that God is sovereign, that He is in complete control, and that His purposes will be achieved. He knew God too well to think any man could anticipate how God would achieve His purposes. Paul believed that he would go to Rome, but he surely did not know how God would arrange for his transportation.

**The gospel is God’s provision for all of our needs**. The gospel is the means through which God overcomes and overturns all of the “fallout” from Adam’s sin (see Romans 5:12-21; 8:18-26). It is the Christian’s motivation and means for godly living (Romans 6-8). It is the key to understanding world history (Romans 9-11). If there is a “need” which the gospel does not meet or address, I doubt that it is a valid need at all. The gospel is God’s provision for sinful men who live in a fallen world. The gospel should be our motivation, our mindset, our message, and our means. 

**Ministry is a long-term matter**. As I read through Paul’s introduction, it becomes more and more evident that the writing of Romans and Paul’s involvement in ministry to the church was not a short-term commitment. Paul had kept up with this church, its witness, its growth, and its needs for many years. He desired to visit Rome for years. He prayed and he planned for a long time before he ever wrote, and then he was “delayed” three more years until he could visit. Good things take time to accomplish. God is not in a hurry, and He does not need last minute programs. Paul looked much farther ahead than we do, and I am convinced that he was right.

**Ministry requires preparation and** **prayer**. Paul’s prayers prepared him for the writing of this epistle. Much of our ministry plans and programs look for quick results. We have a kind of “fast foods” approach to ministry and to evangelism. Paul’s ministry through the pen was preceded by years of ministry through his prayers. His introduction to his epistle drew the attention of the Roman saints to his perseverance in prayer for them. Paul’s words to the Romans were preceded by his prayers to God on their behalf. There is too little preparation for our ministry, and our “messages” to others have little or no introduction by way of prayer or service.
