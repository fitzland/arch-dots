# Attending to Five Kinds of Needs

## **1.	To people’s PhYSICAL needs**

That’s a Christ-like ministry. Jesus says in Matthew 25:

*For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me. . . Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.*

**MATTHEW 25:35–36, 40 (ESV)**

Jesus said, whenever you do something kind for another person in his name, it’s as if you’re doing it directly for the Lord. There are legitimate ministries in our church that simply take care of people’s physical needs—hunger, clothing, food, and things like that. 

Matthew 10:42 says:

*If, as my representatives, you give even a cup of cold water to a little child, you will surely be rewarded.*

**MATTHEW 10:42 (TLB)**

To those of you who are Sunday school teachers, even if you take a little child to the rest room, you’ll be rewarded. Everything is rewarded by God.

## **2.	To people’s EMOTIONAL needs**

People have different kinds of emotional needs, and the Bible says it takes different kinds of ministries.

*Warn the idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.*

**1 Thessalonians 5:14 (GNT)**

We respond to different people in different ways. When you minister a word of counsel or encouragement or comfort, that is ministry.

## **3.	To people’s SPIRITUAL needs**

*All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.*

**2 CORINTHIANS 5:18 (NIV)**

Reconciliation is when you take two opposing parties and you bring them together. When a couple reconciles in a marriage, maybe they’ve been separated, they come back together. That’s reconciliation. Two opposite parties. The Bible says it’s our job as Christians, our ministry, to reconcile people with God. People who have been separated from God, we’re to bring them together.

*So we tell others about Christ . . . teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us. We want to present them to God, perfect in their relationship to Christ.* 

**Colossians 1:28 (NLT)**

There are spiritual needs that need to be ministered to.

## **4.	 To people’s INTELLECTUAL needs**

*Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.*

**Romans 12:2 (NIV)**

## **5.    To people’s RELATIONAL needs**

*Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God’s grace.*

**2 Corinthians 1:12 (NIV)**
