# Romans 3.9-20

### Transition

After an extended discussion on sin and God's wrath, Paul draws a conclusion and an implication from that conclusion.

**Conclusion**: Both Jews and Greeks are ALL under sin.

**Implication**: No one will be declared righteous (justified) in God's sight by observing the Law.


> 9 What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin; 

**better**. *proecho*. meaning surpass; two options: 1) passive voice—are we surpassed? 2) middle voice—do we surpass?

- In either case, question is whether there is any basic difference between Jew and Gentile.
- Paul has asserted the Jews do have certain privileges—received the oracles of God.

**not at all**. *ou pantos*. not with regard to the issue of rescue from God's wrath.

- some support a weaker negative—reading *not entirely*.

**for**. *gar*. reiterates his explanation—no difference because…

**all under sin**. people do not just *commit* sin; they are UNDER sin

### Universality of Sin

> 10 as it is written, “THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;

**as it is written**. Paul substantiates the universality of sin with a series of Old Testament quotations from Psalms and Isaiah.

- in many cases the original context spoke of wicked people—not the Jews in general or people in general

**NONE RIGHTEOUS**. *dikaios*. two options for Paul's quotation…

- taken from Psalm 14.1-3 where it says: *there is no one who does good*.
- alluding to Ecclesiastes 7.10 where it says: *there is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins*.

NOTE. when discussing righteousness of God—there are three ways to understand righteousness

- an attribute of God—God's faithfulness, God's holiness
- a status given to people—God justifies the sinner, God give a new legal standing before him
- an action—God putting into the right; to set right what has gone wrong


> 11 THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS,
>  THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;

**understands**. *suniémi*. to set together, to understand, consider, perceive

seeks. 


> 12 ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS;
>  THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD,
>  THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.”

### Sins of Speech


> 13 “THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE,
>  WITH THEIR TONGUES THEY KEEP DECEIVING,”
>  “THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS”;




> 14 “WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS”;

### Sins of Violence


> 15 “THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD,




> 16 DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS,




> 17 AND THE PATH OF PEACE HAVE THEY NOT KNOWN.”

### Disregard for God


> 18 “THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES.”




> 19 Now we know that whatever the Law says, **it speaks** to those who are **under the Law**, that every **mouth may be closed**, and all the world may become **accountable to God**; 20 because **by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified** in His sight; for through the Law comes the **knowledge of sin**.
