# Employee Handbook

## First Baptist Church of Corsicana

### About This Employee Handbook

We have prepared this handbook as a general statement of our policy and as a guide for general information that should assist you during your employment. The provisions of this handbook are designed to serve as guidelines rather than as  absolute rules, and exceptions may be made from time to time on the basis of particular circumstances.

This employee handbook does not constitute a contract for employment with First Baptist Church either expressed or implied. Employment at First Baptist Church is at-will.

The statements contained in this handbook do not limit the right of either this organization or the employee to terminate the employee’s employment or compensation, with or without cause or notice, at any time. Further, this organization reserves the right at any time to change, delete, or add to any of the provisions or benefits in its sole discretion.

This employee handbook supersedes all prior oral or written policies and guidelines.

If you have executed an employment contract with First Baptist Church, this handbook is intended to accompany and complement that contract. However, if a discrepancy exists between this employee handbook and the employment contract, the language of the employment contract controls.

### Attendance Guidelines

Regular attendance and punctuality are considered essential functions of every employee’s job. Therefore, all employees are expected to arrive on time, ready to work, every day. Our philosophy is that absenteeism is generally controllable. Therefore, absence control is best achieved through individual treatment aimed at the irresponsible, chronic absentee.

We define an absence as failure to report for and remain at work as scheduled. This includes arriving late for work and leaving early without prior supervisory approval. Additionally, absences that exceed the permitted number of hours under the vacation and sick plan may be considered unexcused absences.

If you are unable to arrive at work on time, or must be absent for any portion of the day, you must contact your supervisor as soon as possible. If possible, you should speak directly with your supervisor. If that is not possible, then you must leave a message for your supervisor. Since each department has different needs and internal procedures,  employees must check with their supervisor to determine any additional or specific instructions for reporting absences or tardies.

Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. The standard of what is excessive is determined by the needs of your particular department. 

Nothing in this policy shall affect the at-will status of all employees, nor shall it restrict, constrain, or prohibit managers from applying discipline for other actions. For example, if an employee is late and, upon receiving a warning, responds disrespectfully, the employee may receive additional discipline for insubordination or a negative attitude, up to and including immediate termination. This organization will administer this policy in accordance with federal and state law,  including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act.

### Communication and Electronic Media

First Baptist Church provides a variety of electronic systems and services to improve the effectiveness of communication and information flow. Electronic media means any electronic program, access, or services, including but not limited to,  any computer hardware or software, electronic mail, and the Internet.

#### Electronic Media Use Policy

- First Baptist Church's electronic media and services have been developed and maintained for the specific use of ministry correspondence and communication. For employees’ convenience and expediency, electronic media may be used for  incidental, personal communication and purposes. Good judgment should be used to limit the amount and frequency of such use.
- These systems, including the equipment and the data stored in the systems, are the property of First Baptist Church. Thus, all electronic data or documents created, sent, received, or stored in the systems are this organization’s property.
- Employee communications transmitted by the company systems are not considered private. First Baptist Church has the right to access, monitor, inventory, review, audit, delete, and disclose, with or without notice, for any reason, including time and content, all information sent, communicated or stored on company systems, whether or not they are  communications. Additionally, routine system maintenance or trouble-shooting by system administrators may result in electronic messages being accessed.
- The organization is not responsible for any privately owned equipment used for ministry purposes.
- No equipment or software, including electronic calendaring devices or Personal Digital Assistants, may be attached, installed, or added to company systems without prior approval from the Minister of Administration. The organization reserves the right to remove software, licensed or unlicensed, from any ministry-owned equipment at any time.
- All other First Baptist Church policies, including but not limited to harassment and confidentiality policies, apply to the use of electronic media.

#### Passwords

Access to electronic media is limited to those employees with proper authorization and may require the use of a password. Employees must keep all passwords confidential and out of public view. Care should be taken in setting passwords to avoid making them easily discoverable. Passwords should not be shared.

#### Software Use

- First Baptist Church will provide necessary software for use on ministry computers in accordance with federal copyright law and applicable licensing agreements.

- First Baptist Church does not condone the unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted computer software or documentation. 
- Employees are not permitted to install, execute, run, or load personal software on ministry computers without permission from the Minister of Administration.
- If an employee, with the Minster of Administration's approval, uses personal software on company computers, the employee is responsible for keeping licenses for his or her software.
- First Baptist Church has the right to access, monitor, inventory, review, audit, delete, and disclose, with or without notice, for any reason, including time and content, all information or software sent, communicated or stored on  ministry systems.
- The ministry reserves the right to remove software, licensed or unlicensed, from any ministry-owned equipment or computer at any time.
- Every employee with access to electronic media is responsible for taking the appropriate security measures to prevent loss, misuse and damage, including damage caused by computer viruses. Any unexplained loss or alteration of data should be reported immediately to the business administrator.

#### Unacceptable Uses

- Unacceptable uses of electronic media include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Use for any purpose that violates state or federal laws.
- Use to transmit or access information that is disruptive to the operation of the ministry.
- Use to transmit or access any content that is illicit, unsavory, abusive, pornographic, discriminatory, harassing, or disrespectful.
- Use to create or host any blog that is not approved by First Baptist Church.
- Use to falsify the sender’s or author’s identity or to misrepresent another person.
- Use to transmit or access confidential information to individuals who are not authorized to receive such
  information.
- Use to transmit non-critical, non-business broadcast mail/data, distribution of chain letters or other mass distributions that cause stress on any computer or network system or disrupt the operation of the ministry.

Abuse of any electronic media or services or violation of this policy, through excessive personal use, or use
in violation of law or other First Baptist Church policy, will be subject to immediate review and may result in
disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination of employment and/or legal action.

#### Guidelines

- Employees should keep in mind that electronic messages, depending on their format, can be readily printed, viewed, listened to, or forwarded to other users. Electronic messages also may be mistakenly addressed and sent to the wrong person.
- Although there are security measures in place to protect the privacy of electronic media and communications, it is  impossible to ensure the confidentiality of any electronic message. In using electronic media, employees need to keep in mind the nature of electronic communications.

### Employee Benefit Program

For the benefit of employees and this organization, First Baptist Church provides certain employee benefits outlined within this handbook. All employee benefits are subject to change or elimination at any time at the discretion of the organization. Benefits also may be modified in accordance with federal and state law.

Contact the Minister of Administration with any questions regarding benefits.

### Equal Employment Opportunity

It is the policy of First Baptist Church to grant equal employment opportunity to all qualified persons without regard to race, creed, gender, age, veteran status, disability, or handicap—if such handicap or disability may be accommodated without undue hardship. The recruitment and selection process will be based on job-related, objective qualifications, in accordance with the job requirements of the position being filled. All employees must be able to perform the essential functions of their jobs as set forth in the employee’s individual position description. Reasonable accommodations will be made, in accordance with applicable state and federal law, to assist employees with disabilities in performing the essential functions of their jobs.

First Baptist Church is organized for religious purposes and is substantially controlled and supported by a religious body, the church denomination. Consequently, First Baptist Church enjoys an exemption from the prohibitions contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 concerning religious discrimination in employment. We further reserve the right to discriminate or designate certain positions based on religion or gender when a bona fide occupational qualification exists. Employees who believe they have been unlawfully discriminated against should report it immediately to their supervisor or the Minister of Administration.

#### Guidelines

In all reported cases, this organization will take reasonable steps to protect the reporting employee from retaliatory, harassing, or abusive behavior in relation to such reporting.

### Family and Medical Leave Act

It is the policy of First Baptist Church to provide family and medical leaves in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).

#### Eligibility

The FMLA entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for reasons specified in the FMLA. Under certain circumstances, families caring for service members recovering from a serious injury or illness may take up to 26 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave. You are eligible for FMLA leave if you have, before the first day of your FMLA leave, 1) worked for at least 12 months, and 2) provided 1,250 hours of service within the previous 12-month period. We calculate the 12-month period backward from the date the employee’s FMLA leave begins. If you and your spouse are both employed by First Baptist Church, your combined FMLA leave entitlement is 12 weeks for the birth, adoption, or placement of a child.

#### Reasons for FMLA Leave

FMLA leave will be granted to eligible employees for any of the following reasons:

- The birth, adoption, or placement of a child (12 weeks).
- The care of a spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition (12 weeks).
- The employee’s own serious health condition (12 weeks).
- A “qualifying exigency” arising out of a covered family member’s active duty or call to active duty in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency plan. (12 weeks)
- The care of a covered family member who has become seriously ill or seriously injured in the line of duty in the Armed Forces. (26 weeks)

A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:

- Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or after inpatient care in a medical facility;
- Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities of more than three calendar days and involving continuing treatment by a health care provider;
- Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care; or
- Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or long-term condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three calendar days. Unless complications arise or if left untreated, the common cold, the flu, upset stomachs, headaches, or orthodontic problems will not generally be considered serious health conditions. Routine physical, eye, or dental examinations are not considered treatments indicative of a serious health condition.

#### Guidelines of FMLA Leave

Leave may be taken, if medically necessary, on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for the serious health condition of the employee or an immediate family member. Intermittent or reduced leave may be taken for the birth or adoption of a child only if approved by the Minister of Administration.

First Baptist Church requires the employee to first use his or her paid sick leave, floating holidays, or vacation time for any part of the 12-week (26-week) period. Therefore, all available paid sick leave, floating holidays, and vacation time must be used and will be designated as FMLA leave time before any remaining FMLA leave can be taken on an unpaid basis.

#### Notice and Medical Certification

If you become eligible for leave under the FMLA, you must follow these guidelines:

- You must provide 30 days advance notice when the leave is foreseeable. When the need for leave is not foreseeable, you must provide notice to the Minister of Administration (within two business days of when you become aware of the need for leave). Notice may be provided by your spouse, family member, or other representative if you are unable to do so personally. Failure to provide notice could jeopardize your FMLA status.
- FMLA requires that you attempt to schedule planned medical treatment or intermittent leave so as to avoid undue work-related disruption. This means that in cases where your treating physician is available, you may be required to schedule planned medical treatment outside of general business hours.
- If you take leave to care for a spouse, child, or parent, you must provide a medical certification within *15 calendar days* of the request for leave. Contact the Minister of Administration to obtain a copy of the “Certification of Health Care Provider” form. A second and/or third medical certification at First Baptist Church expense, may be required.
- If you take leave for your own serious health condition, you are required to provide a fitness-for-duty report, along with the “Certification of Health Care Provider” form, before returning to work.
- While on FMLA, you are required to report to the Minister of Administration periodically on your status and your plans to return to work. This organization will take steps to maintain all medical information confidentially in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

#### Benefits During FMLA Leave

You may choose to continue your participation in our health care program while on leave. However, it’s your responsibility to arrange for payment of necessary premiums during your leave. Failure to make the appropriate premium payments may result in the cancellation of your insurance coverage. Additionally, if you fail to return to work at the end of the leave, (name of ministry) has the right to recoup the premiums paid for maintaining health coverage.

#### Returning to Work

When you return to work after your FMLA leave, you will be restored to your original position or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. 

#### Disability Plans and FMLA

Situations may arise in which both this organization’s short-term and/or long-term disability plan and the Family and Medical Leave Act apply. While the purpose of FMLA is to provide 12 weeks (26 weeks) of unpaid, job-protected leave, the purpose of short-term and long-term disability benefits is to help supplement lost income during long periods of incapacity.

Any leave granted under the disability policies shall run concurrently with the 12 weeks (26 weeks) granted under the FMLA. When an employee is eligible for FMLA only, all available paid sick leave, floating holidays, and vacation time must be used and will be designated as FMLA leave time before any remaining FMLA leave can be taken on an unpaid basis.

If you have any questions regarding how FMLA leave is applied, please contact the business administrator.

#### Guidelines

When FMLA leave has been exhausted, employment may be terminated. If employment is not immediately terminated, this organization may designate any and all future absences as unexcused absences. Additionally, when FMLA has begun, and all sick and vacation time has been used, any non-qualifying FMLA absences may be considered unexcused absences.

### Harassment

First Baptist Church will not tolerate any form of harassment, including sexual harassment or any offensive conduct that has the effect of substantially interfering with an employee’s work performance or creating a pervasive, intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

First Baptist Church has instituted the following three-step procedure for reporting and investigating allegations of unlawful harassment, including sexual harassment:

- Reporting: An employee who believes that he or she has been the victim of harassment has a duty to report it immediately to his or her manager, or the business administrator. In all reported cases, this organization will take reasonable steps to protect the reporting employee from retaliatory, harassing, or abusive behavior in relation to such reporting.
- Investigation: The business administrator will direct the investigation of complaints. All employees are expected to cooperate with an investigation of any type of harassment. Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent permitted under such circumstances.
- Corrective Action: After the investigation has been completed, the business administrator will make a determination regarding the resolution of the case. If warranted, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, will be taken.

#### Guidelines

Sexual harassment is present whenever unwelcome sexual advances, (either verbal or physical), requests for favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature have occurred, and submission to such conduct is either an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment; submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions; or the conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

- Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, verbal abuse or physical conduct of a derogatory or offensive nature, the display or communication of pornographic material, or job-related requests for sexual favors. Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments or other conduct that is socially acceptable and does not have a discriminatory effect on the employment relationship.

### Injury and Illness at Work

First Baptist Church carries workers’ compensation insurance on all employees for on-the-job accidents. We will comply with applicable workers’ compensation laws and regulations and will provide information to the workers’ compensation carrier, who will make benefit payments to injured or ill employees as provided by applicable workers’ compensation laws.

If a work-related injury or illness appears life threatening, the 911 emergency number should be called immediately, and directions should be followed. Otherwise, any employee who sustains an injury or illness that is job-related should report this immediately to his or her manager, who will report it to the human resources department. Non-emergency, work-related accidents require authorization forms, located with the business administrator.

All job-related accidents, regardless of their cause or severity, must be reported to the business administrator immediately. Accidents that are not reported promptly may result in the claim being denied. First aid supplies are available at the first aid station.

#### Guidelines

- Accidents include all work-related injuries or illnesses that occur while working for (name of ministry).
- Employees have an obligation to report any work-related injury or illness immediately and return to work as soon after an injury or illness as their medical conditions permit.
- A list of approved medical care facilities may be obtained from the business administrator. 
- Employees who need medical treatment while on company travel should proceed to the nearest medical facility and upon return report it to the business administrator.

### Jury Duty, Court Subpoenas, and Voting

#### Jury Duty and Court Subpoenas

Serving on a jury or testifying as a witness when called is a civic duty, and as such is fully recognized and supported by this organization. The following policy governs the amount of time off and method of payment while serving on jury duty or testifying as a witness.

#### Jury Duty

It is the employee’s responsibility to notify (name of ministry) as soon as a formal notice regarding jury duty is received. This will allow the the business administrator to make arrangements for coverage during this time period. *While serving, employees will be paid their regular pay*. Employees scheduled to work while serving on jury duty should return to work after being excused from jury duty.

#### Court Subpoenas

When an employee is subpoenaed, advance notification should be made through the supervisor. Appearances in court under subpoenas and/or out of civic responsibility (such as an eyewitness) will normally be considered excused time with pay. Time for appearance in court for personal business will be the individual employee’s responsibility. Normally, vacation days will be used for this purpose.

#### Voting

Assuming that an employee has not already voted in early voting, the employee is entitled to take paid time off for voting on election days, unless the employee has at least two consecutive hours to vote outside of the voter's working hours.

Bottom-line considerations:

- Let employees have at least two hours off to vote on an election day (unless they have already voted under early voting procedures).
- Such time off needs to be paid to the extent that it cuts into the employee's normal working hours (V-1532).
- Such time off does not need to be paid if the two hours are available outside of normal working hours (V-1532).
- If the time is taken off from mandatory overtime, the time off should be paid at the rate that would have applied to the time so missed (M-53).
- If the time is taken off from optional overtime voluntarily requested by the employee, the time off does not need to be paid, since the time off would be outside of normal working hours and is time that the employee voluntarily chose to spend working rather than voting (M-53).

### Outside Inquiries

Occasionally, a representative from the media might contact an employee regarding a ministry issue. No employee is to give media interviews without prior approval of the Senior Pastor. If contacted by a representative of the media, employees should forward any inquiries to the Senior Pastor. This policy will ensure that accurate information will be given for those matters that are appropriate for public knowledge.

All written or verbal inquiries regarding the work performance of present or former employees or written or verbal requests for employment recommendations should be directed to the business administrator.

### Overtime

Occasionally an excessive volume of work accumulates or an emergency arises that requires a non-exempt employee to work overtime. Overtime will be required only when necessary, but employees are expected to work overtime when asked to do so. Non-exempt employees are not to work overtime without prior permission of the Minister of Administration.

### Payroll Issues

#### Pay Periods

You will receive, on each payday, a pay stub reflecting the pay earned the two weeks before the payroll week. Payday is normally every other Thursday of the month. First Baptist Church directly deposits employees’ paychecks into their designated personal accounts.

#### Payroll Time Sheets

All employees are responsible for completing time sheets. Time sheets will be submitted on a biweekly basis. Your time sheet should be completed accurately and submitted to your supervisor for approval.

Non-exempt employees should report all time actually worked. Time sheets should also indicate all vacation, sick, or other time away from the office. If your position is classified as non-exempt, you are eligible for overtime pay. Overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor. Sick and vacation time incurred by non-exempt employees may be taken in *15-minute increments*.

Exempt employees should record only absences from work, not actual number of hours worked in a pay period. If your position is classified as exempt, you are not eligible for overtime. Sick and vacation time must be taken in a minimum of one-hour increments.

#### Guidelines

- If a payday falls on a holiday, you will receive a pay check on the preceding workday.
- If you are absent on payday, your pay stub will be held until you return to work, unless other arrangements
  are made.

#### Payroll Deductions		

(Name of ministry) is required by law to make regular deductions for taxes imposed by governmental units. These deductions must be made from all paychecks, and the amounts deducted are turned over directly to the applicable governmental units. Additionally, this organization will make certain deductions from your paychecks as you request.

Under the Social Security Act, your yearly taxable earnings are reported to the Social Security Board, and your benefits are computed upon them. This organization is required to deduct the tax on your salary. The amount deducted is sent to the federal government for credit to your account. The act provides a monthly income for workers and their families when the worker is retired or disabled and for certain payments to survivors in case of death.

This organization will provide, by January 31 of each year, a W-2 statement showing the total amount of your taxable earnings in addition to all deductions taken from your pay during the previous year.

### Performance Appraisals

Performance appraisals will generally be done annually for all employees. More frequent reviews may be given to newly hired individuals and to those who have been promoted during a given year. Managers may conduct special performance reviews of an employee at any time when the employee’s performance, good or bad, warrants special consideration. The performance appraisal has the following objectives:

- To evaluate how the job has been performed.
- To discuss performance with the individual concerned.
- To determine, where necessary, how performance can be improved.
- To evaluate short-term and long-term goals and potential.

The occasion of a performance review does not automatically signify a pay increase.

### Personal Conduct

(Name of ministry) is a non-profit religious organization and is substantially controlled and supported
by a religious body, your denomination or church. More importantly, our organization is a community of
believers who have joined together to meet the spiritual and academic needs of the greater community. Our
organization promotes behavior consistent with the Holy Scriptures. Consequently, when joining (name
of ministry’s) staff, you freely and willingly agree to the standards of behavior outlined in this policy. The
standards included in this policy are not exhaustive; rather, they provide a guideline of conduct we believe is
in accordance with biblical standards.
As representatives of (name of ministry), it is imperative that our actions are above reproach in all things.
Consequently, the following standards of conduct shall apply to all employees. Violations of
these standards are regarded as a serious breach of integrity and could result in discipline, up to and
including termination.
• God’s Word teaches us that certain attributes are desired, including: love, joy, peace, patience, 		
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22–24). These attributes 		
are to be sought, encouraged, and demonstrated in our relationships.
• Scripture further teaches us that certain behaviors should be avoided, including: theft, lying, dishonesty,
gossip, slander, backbiting, profanity, vulgarity, sexual promiscuity (including adultery, homosexual
behavior, and premarital sex), drunkenness, and immodesty of dress.
• Employees shall observe the Sabbath as a day set apart for worship, fellowship, and rest.
• (Name of ministry) recognizes the danger to one’s physical and psychological well-being in the use of 		
certain products. Therefore, employees are to refrain from the use of tobacco in any form, alcoholic 		
beverages, hallucinogenic drugs and substances, or narcotics not authorized by a physician.
