While we are a church fully committed to our Gospel mandate, we’re also a significant corporation with a number of unusual elements on the business side.  To that end, if these questions seem “business heavy”, that’s by design.  While we are blessed to have a wonderful financial services director and office and a fully qualified comptroller (a CPA who volunteers for us), we want someone in this role who loves Jesus, people AND who has a head for leading church life from a business perspective. 

1. Tell us about your conversion, your family and your current faith walk.
2. Describe your involvement level of financial matters.
3. Describe your personnel management style.
4. What is your general view of policies and procedures? A burden or a tool? 
5. We are a committee driven church. How comfortable are your working with different committees? Assembling committees?
6. We have a superintendent for our facilities. What is your knowledge of and comfort level with overseeing building management?
7. We have a financial director and staff. What do you see as your daily interaction with this staff?
8. How would a subordinate describe your leadership style?
