## Introduction

Three weeks ago Danny spoke of a unifying TRUTH.

- that Jesus is Lord. For a Christian everything starts with this *foundational* truth.

Two weeks ago Logan spoke of a unifying SPIRIT.

- our need to be filled & *transformed* by the Spirit. When we live in the Spirit, old things will pass away as we become new.

Last week Ashley spoke of a unifying DEVOTION.

- A love for Christ will move us to *know* Christ; And we get to know him more by spending time in God's Word.

Today I will speak of a unifying ROLE.

- Basically, this message is about service. Each one of us is part of the body of Christ. And, as a part of the body of Christ, we have a function or purpose or job. What is your function? What is your purpose? What is your job?

Today, I hope to help you find *your* place in the body of Christ.

Let's look at the scriptures. Paul wrote to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 12)…

> 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body. ESV

*What does this say?*

It says, we are many parts. Each one of us is different or unique. I'm not like you, and you are not like me. If we were all the same, then we wouldn't be a body. God made each of us in a way that he decided was best for the body. You are the way you are because that's the way God wanted you to be. I am the way I am because that's the way God wanted me to be. It's God's plan. 

God brings us together in the context of a church so that each of us can serve in a unique ROLE. 

*Now, what happens if we don't do our part?*

The body of Christ doesn't function like it should. It's sick or unhealthy. It's ineffective or unproductive.

*This is important*. If we don't do our part; If we don't fulfill our ROLE; If we can't be unified in the body working together, then we won't be able to accomplish our unifying CALL. And if we don't accomplish our unifying CALL, then we won't have a reason for unifying CELEBRATION.

*Why don't we do our part? Why don't we find our role?*

IMMATURITY. 

- We haven't established the foundational TRUTH that Jesus is Lord. 
- We haven't let the SPIRIT work in our lives. Our minds our set on the things of the flesh.
- We haven't developed a DEVOTION towards Christ; therefore we don't know Christ. We don't know how much He loves us.

When you really love someone, you will serve them. When you really love someone, you will make sacrifices for them.

*Maybe we are doing a part, but we find ourselves frustrated.*

- our frustration may result from trying to accomplish a task without additional support; other people aren't doing their part.
- our frustration may result from trying to accomplish a task but by doing the wrong part; we are doing someone else's job.

When we commit ourselves to doing our job; the job God intends for us to do; the job God made us to do; we will find success (fruit) and fulfillment (peace | happiness).

> 4 Now there are varieties of gifts [grace-endowments], but the same Spirit; 5 and there are varieties of service [ministry], but the same Lord; 6 and there are varieties of activities [workings or operation], but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. 7 To each is given the manifestation [coming to light] of the Spirit for the common good. ESV

What does this say? 

In simple terms it says that…

- there are different KINDS of gifts, 
- there are different WAYS of serving,
- and we each do different THINGS.

All we have to do is submit to Him and use our unique abilities for Him.

## Why Don't We Serve?

Have you ever served in some capacity in the church and been frustrated? 

Many of us find ourselves unfulfilled and ineffective because we are doing things that God did not make us to do.

You were confident that you could serve the Lord. You had the will to do it, but you probably forgot that will power is a scarce resource. Just ask my waist line. 

Here are some problems we have in the church.

1. Some people are lazy. They don't want to serve. I don't really have a lot to say about that. 
2. Sometimes people want to help but they don't know what to do.
3. Other people are helping, but I think they're doing the wrong thing. 
4. We don't do enough training with our people. We throw people into a situation and say get at it.
5. We haven't helped people to find their place. To become aware of who God made them to be.

In these situations we won't be fulfilled, and we won't be fruitful. We won't accomplish what God desires for the Body.

If we take account of who we are and how God made us we will be much more effective.

## What is your SHAPE?

To help us today I'm going to use an acrostic. I didn't come up with this, but I like it, and it helps me when I think about my role and how I might serve the body of Christ. The acrostic we are going to use is SHAPE. It's good because we all have particular shapes. 

**Your role or ministry is determined by your SHAPE.**

What God made me to be determines what he intends for me to do. God has a plan for each of us. God is consistent in his plan for each of us. God wouldn't give us particular talents and temperaments, spiritual gifts, and all sorts of life experiences and then not use them! God has a plan. God formed you and shaped you for a particular reason.

### How Has God Shaped Me?

The Bible says in your mother’s womb, God has been molding and shaping you for ministry. And, God knew everything about you.

> I praise you because of the wonderful way you created me…Nothing about me is hidden from you! I was secretly woven together deep in the earth below, but with your own eyes you saw my body being formed. Even before I was born, you had written in your book everything I would do. | Psalm 139:14–16 (CEV)

Here's another thing—There’s nobody else like you in the world. If you don’t do the ministry God planned for you, nobody else will do it—because God made you unique. You might say: Hey I don't like the way God made me. I want to be different. I want to do something else.

Romans 9 says:

> Who do you think you are to question God? Does the clay have the right to ask the potter why he shaped it the way he did? Doesn’t a potter have the right to make a fancy bowl and a plain bowl out of the same lump of clay?” | Romans 9:20–21 (CEV)
>

We shouldn't question God by saying, “Why didn’t you make me different? Why didn’t you give me…this ability, or… that ability. Why couldn't I be taller, thinner, better looking…whatever.” God made us in a special way, and the gifts, abilities and background He’s given you have a specific purpose and intent. What God made you to be should inform the role or ministry you’re to have. 

**What I do follows who I am.**

What are the things that determine who I am? There are five things that influence who you are: 

#### S. Spiritual Gifts

> God has given different gifts to each of us. | 1 Corinthians 7:7 (CEV)

So the first question we’re going to look at is “What am I gifted to do?” You will or should have looked at this question in your Bible study today. Paul says the Spirit gives each of us different gifts. You can find three biblical lists of the gifts in Romans 12.6-8, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11, and Ephesians 4.11.

If we look at the apostle Paul we find that he had at least three spiritual gifts:

> My work is to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. | 2 Timothy 1:11 (CEV)
>

He was a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. We know those three for sure. He may have had other gifts.

- Preaching—the ability to publicly communicate God's Word in an inspired way.
- Apostleship—the ability to start new churches. Sent out to build where no one else had built. 
- Teaching—the ability to clearly instruct and communicate knowledge.

In my own life, I believe that God has granted me the gifts of service, discernment, and administration.

A couple of things that should be said about spiritual gifts. 

- Our gifts do not make us superior to others. It doesn't work that way.
- We should all manifest the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5.22-23).
- Trying to use my gifts without love is pointless. 

#### H. Heart

> God is working in you to make you willing and able to obey him. | Philippians 2:13 (CEV)

The question you want to ask here is, "What do I love to do? What am I passionate about?"

Isn’t it true there are some things you love to do and there’s just some things you hate to do? That’s your heart. Where did you get that natural inclination? God put it in you. God wants your ministry to be a blessing, not a burden. So it’s a legitimate question to ask yourself, "What do I love to do? What do I have a passion for more than anything else? Why would God give you a ministry that He hasn’t given you a heart for?"

Paul tells us where his heart is. He writes it out in several verses:

> But I have always tried to preach where people have never heard about Christ. I am like a builder who doesn’t build on anyone else’s foundation. | Romans 15:20 (CEV)

We see two things here. “First,” he said, “My heart is to build from scratch, to not go into areas where there are already churches, but go where there are no churches at all. That’s one part of my heart. Second, it’s to go to the unchurched Gentiles. I’m not going to go to the Jew who knows about God. I’m going to go to the Gentiles.”  Then he says:                                  

> But I don’t care what happens to me, as long as I finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do. | Acts 20.24

So two questions might be—What am I gifted to do? What do I love to do?

For me, I have a passion for helping people and in particular people who are struggling, I enjoy working with tech and problem-solving. 

#### A. Abilities

Natural talents and vocational skills are different from spiritual gifts. The Bible says:

> *There are different abilities to perform service.* | 1 Corinthians 12:6 (GNT)

> *I [God] have given him the skill, ability, and knowledge to do all kinds of work.* | Exodus 31:3 (NCV)

Those are vocational skills. God says He gives people abilities. 2 Corinthians 3:5 says:

> *Our competence comes from God.* | 2 Corinthians 3:5 (NIV)

What was Paul’s ABILITY? In addition to his gifts, did he have any special vocational skills or natural talents? Yes, he did. Acts 18 says:

> *Paul went to see them, and stayed and worked with them, because he earned his living by making tents, just as they did. He [debated] in the synagogue every Sabbath, trying to convince both Jews and [Gentiles].* | Acts 18:2–4 (GNT)

This verse tells us about two different abilities that Paul had. He had the ability to work with his hands. He made tents. Some of you are incredibly talented at crafts. Where do you think you got that ability? What do you think God wants to do with that? Not just make pretty things for your home. He wants to use that in ministry. Some of you are good at macramé. Some of you are good at fixing things. There’s a place in ministry for that. 

Then Paul also had the ability to debate. He was an incredible debater—a brilliant mind, a genius. To have debated Paul would have been to take on a pro. He had that ability—to think fast. 

The third question to ask yourself is, “What natural talent and skills do I have? What vocational skills have I learned? What natural talents have I been given by God?”

For me, I've always enjoyed working with spreadsheets. I have a natural inclination towards numbers.

#### P. Personality

This is the fourth thing we’re going to look at. We’re all very different. We’ve all got different personalities, different blends of temperament.  1 Corinthians 2:11 says:

> *No one can really know what anyone else is thinking or what he is really like except that person himself.*  | 1 Corinthians 2:11 (TLB)

What was Paul’s personality? Galatians 1:13-14 says:

*For you have heard of my past . . . I persecuted the Church of God with fanatical zeal and . . . did my best to destroy it. I was ahead of most of my contemporaries in the Jewish religion, and had a greater enthusiasm.*

**Galatians 1:13–14 (PHILLIPS)**

Those verses talk about Paul’s personality. He said, “I was a zealous person; people thought I was fanatical. And I was ahead of everybody else. I was at the top of my field. I did my best. I had boundless enthusiasm.” 

Would you say Paul was an introvert or an extrovert? No question!     He’s an off-the-scale extrovert. 

So we’re going to ask ourselves, Where does my personality best suit me to serve?

If you are an introverted person, I’d suggest you not get involved in the Greeters Ministry. That’s going to put a lot of additional stress on your life. When you have an area that you may be gifted to do and a heart to do, but you don’t have personality to do, it puts enormous stress on your life. God doesn’t want you to have to do that. 

There are all sorts of personality tests out there. In Myers-Briggs, I'm a INTJ. This tells me that I'm more introverted than extroverted. I'm more intuitive than sensing. I'm more thinking than feeling, and I'm more judging than 

#### E. Experiences

Note. You might have had a lot of bad experiences. Why? Well, maybe God wants to use your experiences to bring comfort to someone else. God doesn't waste a hurt.

> *There is nothing better than for people to eat and drink and to see the good in their hard work. These beautiful gifts, I realized, too, come from God’s hand.* | Ecclesiastes 2:24 (VOICE)

Your experiences help determine the direction you should move toward in ministry. We’re going to walk through four different kinds of experiences you want to look at when you’re trying to discover your shape.

Paul’s EXPERIENCES, let’s look at these.

**HIS EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES**

“*I received my training at the feet of Gamaliel,* *and I was schooled in the strictest observance*   *of our fathers’ Law.”*

**Acts 22:3 (PHILLIPS)**

Gamaliel was the number one Jewish teacher in those days. It was like studying from the most important Bible scholar around. Paul said, “I was personally trained by the greatest Biblical scholar of that day.”

**HIS WORK EXPERIENCES**

*Paul went to see them, and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.*

**Acts 18:1-3 (NIV)**

**HIS SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES**

What were his spiritual experiences? There were a number he tells us about:

- ​	Watching Stephen be stoned (Acts 7:54–8:1)
- ​	Conversion on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1–20)
- ​	Three years maturing (Galatians 1:18)
- ​	Special vision from God (2 Corinthians 12:2–7)

**HIS MINISTRY EXPERIENCES** 

His ministry experiences -- read the book of Acts. The book of Acts tells the full ministry experiences of Paul.

- ​	Spreading Christianity throughout the Roman Empire (Acts 13-28)
- ​	Bringing the gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 22:21)

**HIS PAINFUL EXPERIENCES**

Paul had both internal and external painful experiences. Starting with the internal, look at 2 Corinthians 12:7:

*Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.*

**2 Corinthians 12:7 (NIV)**

We have no idea what that was. I think God intentionally didn’t tell us what Paul’s thorn was so that everybody could relate to it. Some people think he had poor eyesight. Some people think he had epilepsy. Some people think it was his wife! We don’t know what it was. But he had a thorn in his flesh. Some people think it was depression. There are a lot of theories. But the fact is, there was something in his life that was a handicap and kept him from serving God as fully as he wanted to. He said it was a thing that was really for his good and kept him from being puffed up with pride. 

Paul also faced many external experiences that were painful: 

*I have been in prison more times . . . near death often . . . five times I was whipped and given thirty-nine lashes by the Jews; three times I was whipped by the Romans; and once I was stoned. I have been in three shipwrecks, and once I spent twenty-four hours in the water. In my many travels I’ve been in danger from floods . . . robbers . . . enemies . . . dangers in the wild . . . false friends. There has been work and toil; often I have gone without sleep; I have been hungry and thirsty; I have often been without enough food, shelter, or clothing.*

**2 Corinthians 11:23–27 (GNT)**

Did Paul have any painful experiences? I’d say he had a few! Those helped shape his life. 

You can see how these things shaped his life. They are very clear.  			 			  				 		

You should know this church needs you. We cannot fulfill God's purpose for the church in this community unless each one of us does his part---fulfills his role.

Your ministry will be most effective and fulfilling when you are using your **gifts** and **abilities** in the area of your **heart’s desire** in a way that best expresses your **personality** and **experience**!

If we look at Paul’s Spiritual Gifts, his Heart, his Abilities, his Personality, and his Experiences, how did God use those five things to make Paul effective in ministry?
