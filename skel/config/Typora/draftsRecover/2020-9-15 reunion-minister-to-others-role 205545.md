# Minister to Others

> "Serve one another through love" (Galatians 5:13).

Show God's love by meeting needs of others inside the body of Christ and those who are yet to believe. Build up the body of Christ through loving service in His name.

Jesus modeled a life of service for His disciples and for us. He did not come to be served but to serve others. His calling to us is to a life of service to those who are needy both in the body of Christ and in the world that has not yet believed. When we love and serve others who are needy, we show our love for Christ Himself, and God uses that service to build up the body of Christ.

## Serving like Jesus

#### God's Word for Today

> "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and their men of high positions exercise power over them. But it must not be like that among you. On the contrary, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you must be a slave to all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life—a ransom for many."—Mark 10:42-45

#### Responding to the Lord

Lord Jesus, You gave me a wonderful example of One who serves others. I'm so grateful to You for all You've done for me. I want to become a servant like You, knowing that servanthood is how You determine greatness in Your kingdom. Open my eyes to see needs of others; and give me the boldness, courage, and resources needed to serve them. Make me more and more like You. Amen.

#### Optional Reading

John 13:1-17

**↕ Read "God's Word for Today" above and respond to the Lord in prayer. As your time permits, consider the "Optional Reading" also. As you read it in your Bible, mark verses that are particularly meaningful. Talk to God about what you are reading. The "Optional Readings" this week focus on instructions and examples of service. Today's "Optional Reading" describes how Jesus modeled service by washing the disciples' feet.**

One day James and John asked Jesus to give them special places of leadership in His kingdom. When the other disciples heard about it, they were upset with them. Jesus called the Twelve together and explained that importance in His kingdom would be measured on a different basis.

**What are some ways humans typically claim greatness or influence?**

- People claim influence based on their title or position.
- People exercise influence because of their wealth or education.
- People falsely assume power based on a presumed ethnic or racial superiority.
- People claim places of influence because of cultural or social status.
- People claim influence based on personal accomplishment or fame.

People use all of these reasons to claim a position of influence or power over others. Jesus, however, gave a different basis for measuring greatness in His kingdom. The great ones in His kingdom are those who serve. Jesus went on to offer Himself as an example of sacrificial service. He said, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life—a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45). On the night before He went to the cross, He acted like a common slave and washed the dirty feet of His disciples. He said, "I have given you an example that you also should do just as I have done for you" (John 13:15). 

*By Christ's standards a place of humble service in the body of Christ is an important place of greatness.*

**Reflect on these encouraging words. Which statements are most encouraging to you? Explain.**

- "We've been called to make a difference."
- "We are able by the gifts of God."
- "We are able by His Spirit."
- "We can reach out ... in all confidence."
- "The Father finishes what He begins."
- "The Lord of all at work in us."
- "God ... equips the called."
- "We are able!"

**Do you recall a time God called you and then equipped you to complete an assignment for Him? Or has God asked you to do something in ministry that you have not yet obeyed? If so, briefly describe one or both experiences below.**

**↕ Take a moment to thank God for what He has already done in your life to call and equip you. Pledge to carry out the assignments He has given.**

## Serving to Build Up the Body of Christ

#### God's Word for Today

> "It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."—Ephesians 4:11-13, NIV

#### Responding to the Lord

Lord Jesus, I'm a part of the body of Christ for my world. This is a lofty goal that we should be built up in unity to become mature and reach fullness in Christ. I know only You could accomplish such a miracle. Thank you for giving me leaders who can train me and prepare me for service in such a way that I can contribute to building up Your body. Show me when and how to serve. Help me grow in maturity and Christlikeness, too. Amen.

#### Optional Reading

Ephesians 4

**↕ Read and briefly meditate on "God's Word for Today" above and respond to the Lord in prayer. Use the written prayer or pray your own.**

The more you become like Jesus, the more you will be a servant like Jesus. Together with other believers we make up the body of Christ, with Christ as our Head. Ephesians 4:11-13 explains how the body of Christ is built up, experiences unity, grows in spiritual maturity, and becomes increasingly Christlike.

**Read Ephesians 4:11-13 again. Match the people on the left with the correct function on the right. Write a letter beside each number. Click for answer(s)**

|      | 1. apostles                 | a. Equip God's people for service                      |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | 2. prophets                 | b. Prepare and serve the body of Christ to build it up |
|      | 3. evangelists              |                                                        |
|      | 4. pastors/teachers         |                                                        |
|      | 5. the rest of God's people |                                                        |

Is that the way you thought the church was to function? Too many churches think they pay a pastor or staff member to do the work of serving the church. But healthy churches function the way God intended them. Leaders equip God's people, who all have a part in building up the body of Christ and in growing into maturity and Christlikeness.

When I was working in New York City, I took a group of visiting seminary students to an ethnic church in Brooklyn for a Sunday service. We were escorted through the main worship center, where about 1,500 people met for a French service. In the gymnasium about 500 youth and young adults met for a service in English. After the service we met with Pastor Thomas. We learned that their church was active in world missions and aggressively started new churches in other cities (about 50 to date). One student asked, "How many paid staff members do you have?"

We were all shocked by his reply: "None." That's not your typical church these days, especially not one with 2,000 in worship on Sundays. He said, "JPMorgan Chase pays my pension." He worked for the bank to earn a living. This church had started in his home almost 40 years earlier. He went on to explain his conviction that "when you get saved, you get a job. My job is to be the pastor." He asks his people to pray and seek the Lord's will about their job in the church. Then he and other leaders help equip them to share in the work God has assigned their church. Sounds like Ephesians 4:11-13, doesn't it?

**On the Disciple' s Cross, five types of ministry are listed. Look at the diagram and complete the following chart.**

| Discipline                     | Ministry                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1. Live in the Word            | Ministry of ________________________ |
| 2. Pray in Faith               | Ministry of ________________________ |
| 3. Fellowship with Believers   | Ministry of ________________________ |
| 4. Witness to the World        | Ministry of ________________________ |
| 5. Both Fellowship and Witness | Ministry of Service                  |

**↕ Pray and ask the Lord to reveal to you any ministry assignment He may have for you at this point in your Christian life. Keep in mind, however, that sometimes you need to be on the receiving end of a ministry. We don't put God on our timetable, so if He doesn't speak to you about a specific ministry assignment, you don't have to make one up.**

**③ Read the brief descriptions of these broad ministries below. Write below anything you sense God wants you to do in ministry to others or describe a way you need to receive ministry from someone else.**

#### Five Ministries of the Disciple's Cross

\1. Ministry of Teaching/Preaching. God calls some to teach and preach to help people understand and apply God's Word in their lives. You don't need a position to teach others what God is teaching you.

\2. Ministry of Worship/Intercession. Worship is individual and corporate ministry to the Lord. Intercession is serious prayer in behalf of others.

\3. Ministry of Nurture. Believers need to grow from being new in faith to maturity. They need to learn to apply God's truths in relationships. They need a model to help them learn to be faithful followers of Jesus Christ.

\4. Ministry of Evangelism. All should be witnesses, but some are especially gifted to lead others to faith in Christ in very productive ways.

\5. Ministry of Service is meeting needs of believers and those who have not yet believed.

Ministry for me to undertake:


Ministry I need to receive:

**↕ Being part of the body of Christ involves finding your place in service to the Lord. Ask the Lord to show you where you can begin serving Him and His church. Pray for your leaders as they lead your church to follow Christ as Head and to function as the body of Christ before a watching world.**

## Showing Love by Meeting Needs

#### God's Word for Today

> "Serve one another through love."—Galatians 5:13

#### Responding to the Lord

Father, You first loved me and sent Your Son to pay for my sins. Now You've saved me from sin and given me the wonderful assignment of being Your coworker in the kingdom. I'm blessed! Give me Your heart of compassion for those who are needy around me. Help me enjoy serving them through love. Amen.

#### Optional Reading

Matthew 25:31-46

**↕ Read and briefly meditate on "God's Word for Today" above and respond to the Lord in prayer. Use the written prayer or pray your own.**

In Matthew 25:31-46 (today's "Optional Reading") Jesus told a sobering story about the end times. In the end Jesus will separate His sheep from the goats. His sheep will enter eternal life, and the goats will go to eternal punishment.

**① If you haven't done so, read Matthew 25:31-46 in your Bible. Write beside the people described below what Jesus expected to be done for them.**

\1. Hungry:




\2. Thirsty:




\3. Stranger:




\4. Naked:




\5. Sick and prisoner:




Those who are His sheep will have served Christ and ministered to Him by feeding the hungry, quenching the thirst of the thirsty, showing hospitality to strangers, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and imprisoned. Those who serve others in these ways have served Christ Himself. Jesus was not saying that eternal life could be earned in this way. Rather, He made clear that those who belonged to Him would care about the needy and have compassion on them just as Christ would. Jesus described ways you can show your love and care for Him by loving and meeting the needs of others.

In Concentric Circles of Concern Oscar Thompson told a story about one of his students. Jerry got off work one night and found that his motorcycle mirror had been stolen. He found it on another motorcycle in the company parking lot. In anger he took back his mirror and flooded the thief's motorcycle so that it wouldn't start. The next day Jerry began to feel guilt about his response. As he prayed, God led him to respond in love. That night Jerry bought a new mirror and put it on the other person's motorcycle. He left a message explaining that he was a Christian and that God wouldn't tolerate his kind of behavior. He asked forgiveness, signed his name, and gave a phone number. Later that night Jerry got a call. The thief explained that he'd stolen many things in his life, but no one had every treated him like this before. He wanted to talk. That night Jerry led the man to faith in Christ. In his book Thompson gives this definition of love: "Love is meeting needs."1

*"Love is meeting needs."*

**Suppose you knew people who had the needs listed in the left column below. How could you demonstrate your love by meeting those needs? Match each need on the left with a way to meet the need on the right.** 

| **Need**         | **Possible Way to Meet the Need**                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Lonely        | a. Find/provide shelter                            |
| 2. Grieving      | b. Babysit the children                            |
| 3. Jobless       | c. Spend time talking/visiting                     |
| 4. Hungry        | d. Network him with an employer needing his skills |
| 5. Single parent | e. Teach literacy class or tutor                   |
| 6. Homeless      | f. Provide food                                    |
| 7. Can't read    | g. Comfort, help her talk about good memories      |

Ways to meet a need may vary, depending on the circumstances. If God wants you to help meet the need, spend enough time with the needy person or group to see how to help effectively. Keep in mind that love will be costly and may require sacrifice. Sometimes you will be unable to meet the need alone. Don't hesitate to enlist others to help meet the need.

When you become aware of a need, ask, "Lord, do You want to meet that need through me?" Then obey Him.

Prayer should also be a major part of your seeking directions on ways to help. Not every need is a call for your response. However, when you become aware of a need, ask, "Lord, do You want to meet that need through me?" Then obey Him.

You may minister to other believers in the body of Christ and show love by meeting needs. God has given us the church as a place to practice loving. He can use the needs in the church to expand your capacity to love deeply. But God will also bring across your path those who have not yet believed. They may be unlovely, mean, or even evil. As you love these who don't expect your love, God may work through you to bring them to faith in His Son.

**↕ Pray about the people in your circles of contact. Are there needy people God is already prompting you to help? Ask Him. Pray that your church will be sensitive to the needs of people in your community.**

## Comforting One Another

#### God's Word for Today

> "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort. He comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction, through the comfort we ourselves receive from God."—2 Corinthians 1:3-4

#### Responding to the Lord

God of all comfort, I thank You for the ways You comfort me when I need to be comforted—times when I've needed Your mercies. Now, because I've been comforted, I've been equipped to help others who are experiencing the same needs I had. Love them through me. Comfort them through me. Let Your love flow through me to touch the lives of others around me. Amen.

#### Optional Reading

Isaiah 58

**↕ Read and briefly meditate on "God's Word for Today" above and respond to the Lord in prayer. Use the written prayer or pray your own.**

Henry Blackaby and I were teaching Experiencing God at a conference in New Mexico. I was leading a time of testimonies when a young man from Texas asked for prayer. His father had just died. He asked if someone who had experienced the death of a father would come and pray with him. The man sitting beside him had prayed as he entered the room that evening, "Lord, where do You want me to sit?" He had felt led to sit beside this young man. Now he knew God was up to something. His father had died not long before, and God had comforted him during that time of grief. He knew how to pray for this brother who was grieving the loss of his dad because he had been in that same position himself.

When you have experienced a trial or a difficult circumstance, and God has worked to bring you through the problem, you have been equipped for His service.

After he prayed, they began to talk about their experiences. The man who prayed found out that the man from Texas lived in the very city where his widowed mother lived. The man who had requested prayer now realized God was inviting him to help the mother of the man who had just prayed for him. God places members in the body of Christ to show concern for other members. When one needs comfort, God uses other members to provide it.

God is the God of all comfort. He is the Father of mercies. "He comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction, through the comfort we ourselves receive from God" (2 Corinthians 1:4). When you have experienced a trial or a difficult circumstance, and God has worked to bring you through the problem, you have been equipped for His service.

**Have you been comforted by God in a way that would equip you to minister to someone else in similar circumstances? If so, when and how did God comfort you? Consider experiences of abandonment, loneliness, the death of a loved one, a business failure, the loss of a job, a financial crisis, the illness of a family member, homelessness, deliverance from an addiction, being a victim of abuse or crime or a natural disaster, dealing with a wayward child, or any other experience in which God comforted you.**


### HELPING THE WEAK, OPPRESSED, AND NEEDY


In Isaiah 58 God describes activities that are pleasing to Him:

- To break the chains of wickedness,
- to untie the ropes of the yoke,
- to set the oppressed free,
- and to tear off every yoke?
- Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
- to bring the poor and homeless into your house,
- to clothe the naked when you see him,
- and to not ignore your own flesh and blood?
- If you get rid of the yoke from those around you,
- the finger-pointing and malicious speaking,
- and if you offer yourself to the hungry,
- and satisfy the afflicted one (Isaiah 58:6-7, 9-10).

God made wonderful promises to people who do such things. He promised light, recovery, righteousness, protection, and answered prayer. He promised to lead, provide for, and strengthen you.

**↕ Pause to pray and ask God to reveal to you anyone to whom He wants you to minister. Invite Him to open your eyes in the coming days to reveal people who have needs that you can meet. Also consider that God may want you to work together with another person or group to accomplish ministry that you cannot do alone. Consider such things as ...**

- helping the poor, needy, hungry, homeless;
- helping widows or orphans (either here or in foreign lands);
- taking a stand for a person who is oppressed, mistreated, abused, or needing justice;
- helping a stranger or an alien;
- standing up for one who is persecuted, taken advantage of, cheated, robbed, discriminated against, or defrauded.

**Write below any action you sense God is leading you to take.**

## Growing as a Disciple

#### God's Word for Today

> "I pray that He may grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, and that the Messiah may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and width, height and depth, and to know the Messiah's love that surpasses knowledge, so you may be filled with all the fullness of God."—Ephesians 3:16-19

#### Responding to the Lord

Lord, what a prayer Paul prayed for the Ephesians! I pray this for my church and especially for the people in my small group. Grow us. Strengthen us. Fill us up with the fullness of Christ.

Amen.

Colossians 1

**↕ Read and briefly meditate on "God's Word for Today" above and respond to the Lord in prayer. Use the written prayer or pray your own.**

When I was in elementary school, my family visited another family. They had a child who was probably seven years old, but he was still in diapers and had to be fed and carried around because of a disability. I remember being very disturbed. Children are supposed to grow up, not remain as babies. That's also true for disciples. God never intended for us to remain babies in Christ. He wants us to grow. I pray that the past seven weeks have helped you grow significantly in your walk of following Christ. This is not the end of your growth but just a time of transition. What is next for you?

**If your leader has given you a spiritual-assessment tool, take time to complete it before continuing. Download and print out the Spiritual Growth Assessment Tool. In a subjective way this tool helps you identify how well you are developing in the six disciplines we've studied. It's not scientific, but the results together with prayer may give you some direction about where you need to work in your continuing growth as a follower of Jesus Christ.**

**↕ Pray and ask the Lord to guide you in choosing a next step in your discipleship training.**

**Turn to page 100 and read the recommendations for further study in each of the disciplines. Circle those that you believe would be particularly helpful in your next steps of spiritual growth. In your small-group session you will be able to discuss next steps with others.**
