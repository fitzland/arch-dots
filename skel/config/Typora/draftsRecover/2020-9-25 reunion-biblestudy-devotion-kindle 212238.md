## Bible Comment

### Knowing Christ

> I gave up all that inferior stuff so I could **know** Christ personally, experience his resurrection power, be a partner in his suffering, and go all the way with him to death itself. | Philippians 3:10, MSG

**Point**. We as Christ followers should have a burning passion and desire to know Christ, to know everything about Him, to understand Him and emulate Him. The way we get to know Christ as Paul is referring to here, is by *abiding*.

Abiding in Christ is essential to having a heart for unity. Jesus invites you to a love relationship with Himself. He wants you to know, understand, and live according to His commands so that you can experience the best life God has to offer you. His Word and prayer are the tools through which we speak to Him and He speaks to us. By abiding in Christ, you receive all the life and vitality you need to be filled with joy, fruitfulness and passion. 

### Abiding in the Vine

> I am the vine, you are the branches; 
> he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, 
> for apart from Me you can do nothing.
>
> John 15:5, NIV

*What does the word abide mean?*

The word *abide* is not used much these days. To *abide* means *to continue in, to dwell, to remain, or to stand*. Jesus told the parable of the Vine to make His meaning more clear. Just as a branch is connected to a grapevine, He wants us to be solidly connected to Him. 

*What truths are revealed from the illustration of the vine and its branches?*

…The vine and the branch are **of the same substance**, the same wood.

…A branch that is grafted into the vine sends fibers down into the vine and vice versa until **they become one**.

…The **branch needs the vine** in order to live; it receives sap from the vine.

…The **vine needs the branch** in order to bear fruit. The vine cannot produce fruit by itself.

As your devotion to Christ develops, so will your abiding relationship with Him. The depth, strength and joy of that relationship grows as you spend time with Christ learning from Him, becoming like Him, receiving from Him, and obeying Him.

*What is your attitude toward spending time with your Master in prayer and reading His Word?*

1. I enjoy time with Christ and look forward to it daily.
2. I dread taking time to pray and read God's Word. I find it very difficult to do.
3. Based on past experience, I've not been very interested in time with my Master.
4. I want Christ to increase my desire for time with Him.

### Experiencing Oneness with Christ

> If anyone loves me, they will obey me. Then my Father will love them, and we will come to them and live in them. | John 14:23, CEV

Can you believe that Jesus and the Heavenly Father want to come and make their home with you? To abide in Christ, you love and obey Him, and He takes up residence in your life.

Look at the following passages to see how Jesus set an example for us to follow in abiding. 

> The Son cannot do anything on his own. He can do only what he sees the Father doing. | John 5:19, CEV

> I carry out the will of the one who sent me, not my own will. | John 5:30, NLT

> My message is not my own; it comes from God who sent me. | John 7:16, NLT

> I do nothing on my own but say only what the Father taught me. | John 8:28, NLT

> I don’t speak on my own authority. The Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to say it. And I know his commands lead to eternal life; so I say whatever the Father tells me to say. | John 12:49-50, NLT

**Oneness with the Father**. This oneness was so intimate that to know one was to know both. Jesus said to His disciples…

> If you had really known me, you would know who my Father is. | John 14:7, NLT

But when Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, Jesus said that He had already shown them the Father through His words and works:

> Jesus said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 

> Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works. 

> Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves. | John 14:9-11

Answer the following questions based on Jesus' words above.

*Where was the Father in relationship to Jesus and Jesus to the Father?*

*Where did Jesus' words and works come from?*

Jesus was in the Father, and the Father was in Jesus. That's a mystery, isn't it? Jesus didn't speak on His own initiative; He spoke the words the Father gave Him. He didn't work on His own; the Father worked through Him. Jesus said similar things on several occasions making clear that His works and words came from the Father. 

Just as Jesus had a oneness with the Father, He wants us to experience that same oneness with Him. He wants **to be in us**, and He wants us **to live in Him**. He wants **His words to abide in us**, and He explained that we **cannot do anything apart from Him**. 

Any fruit we bear comes because of **His working in us and through us**. This doesn't mean we are passive and uninvolved. It means that *we allow God to set the agenda and give the assignment*. Then we depend on His Holy Spirit to empower and enable us to do what He desires.

This intimate love relationship and oneness with Jesus Christ are the basis for abiding in Christ. This discipline is not just a set of religious activities you do. It describes a relationship you have with a person—Jesus Christ.

*Abide in Christ* is the central discipline in our walk with Christ. Without this relationship with Christ, however, finding your role in the church, fulfilling your calling and then celebrating the ways the Lord has worked will be difficult. Together they help you grow toward spiritual maturity and a balanced life of discipleship.

### Spending Time with the Master

> If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, 
>  you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. | John 15:7, NKJV

If we are to abide in Christ, we must take time to be with Him. We need to listen to Him speak through His Word and prayer. We need to surrender our lives to God's work of molding and shaping us into the image of His Son.

**Point**. Jesus taught His disciples to pray, but the teaching began as they watched Him devote Himself to prayer. They observed as Jesus spent time with His Father in prayer, and then they saw the fruit of the prayers in what Jesus said and did.

*When and where did Jesus pray?*

> He often withdrew to deserted places and prayed. | Luke 5:16

> During those days He went out to the mountain to pray and spent all night in prayer to God. | Luke 6:12

> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, He got up, went out, and made His way to a deserted place. And He was praying there. | Mark 1:35

> After He said goodbye to them, He went away to the mountain to pray. 
>  When evening came ... He was alone on the land. | Mark 6:46-47

**When**

…early in the morning. 

…all night.

…evening.

…when he was alone.

**Where**

…deserted places.

…out to the mountain.

*Prayer is not just a religious activity you complete and check off your to-do list. Prayer is a relationship with God.*

Jesus prayed to understand His Father's will about where He preached and ministered (Mark 1:35-39). He spent all night praying before He chose the twelve disciples whom He named apostles (Luke 6:12-16). Critical decisions like these required much prayer. Jesus said, "I have not spoken on My own, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a command as to what I should say and what I should speak" (John 12:49). Jesus received the words He spoke and taught while in prayer with His Father.

*If Jesus needed to spend time with His Father in order know and do His will, do you think we need to spend time with our Heavenly Father to know and do His will?* 

#### CULTIVATING A LOVE RELATIONSHIP

Story from Claude King: 

*“When I was in the eighth grade, my science teacher took me arrowhead hunting. We gathered enough Native American artifacts to fill a sack—and I was hooked! I found some sites near my home, and I spent hours walking the plowed fields looking for artifacts. My mind wasn't too busy during those hours, so I often found myself talking to God about everything going on in my life. I would talk to Him about problems I was facing, decisions I needed to make, and relationships that needed help. I asked Him to reveal His will or give directions so that I could follow Him. Sometimes I reviewed all of His blessings to me and gave thanks. I praised Him for the beauty of His creation and expressed my love for Him. As I spent time with my Heavenly Father, He cultivated a deep and abiding love relationship with me. That kind of relationship comes only with time. It can't develop with only brief moments.”*

### Bearing Spiritual Fruit

> By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; 
>  so you will be My disciples. | John 15:8, NKJV

**Point**. Jesus wants you to bear much fruit that will bring glory to the Father. 

Glory is evidence that God has accomplished significant work in you. One way God works in you to produce fruit is molding and shaping you to be like Christ. 

> We all, with unveiled faces, are reflecting the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory. | 2 Corinthians 3:18

God wants you to be like Jesus. The branch and the Vine become one—the Vine in the branch and the branch in the Vine. In Galatians Paul described spiritual fruit that the Holy Spirit produces in the life of a person who is surrendered to the Spirit's control.

Abiding in Christ is not just for the benefit of the branch. Yes, the branch receives sap from the Vine to grow strong. But this is for one purpose: to bear fruit by bringing men and women to the Savior. We will talk  on this further when we talk about our role and calling. 

#### Pruning Required

In the parable of the Vine, God is the Vine Keeper or Husbandman who prunes the branch so that it will be more fruitful. Though pruning may be painful in the short term, the good and loving goal of the Father is to make you very fruitful for His glory. 

God uses *all things* to work for your good. He uses the Scriptures to reveal what Jesus is like so that you can make adjustments by choice. He can use good things to encourage and strengthen you. But He also uses the difficult, bad, and even evil things that may happen to you to accomplish good in your life. Like a sculptor removing pieces of marble to reveal the angel he's carving, God chips away everything in your life, mind, and behavior that doesn't look like Jesus. Knowing that in the end you can be more like Jesus will help you endure the times of trial that may come. 

### Obeying Christ's Commands

> If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, 
>  just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. | John 15:10

**Point**. Jesus explained that obedience and love go together.

When God first placed Adam and Eve in the garden, He gave them only one command. He wanted obedience from His creation. Yet they rebelled against God's command, and sin entered the world. That broken relationship separated humans from their Creator. Jesus restored our opportunity to have a right relationship with God through His obedience on the cross. Paul tells us, "Just as through one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous" (Romans 5:19). 

God created you and has called you to a love relationship with Himself. You show your love for Him by your obedience to His commands. Jesus modeled that loving obedience in His own life with the Father by keeping the Father's commandments (John 15:10). 

*When we obey, we receive the reward of abiding in the Savior's love.*

Read the following Scriptures and answer the question that follows.

> If you love Me, you will keep My commandments. | John 14:15

> The one who has My commands and keeps them is the one who loves Me. And the one who loves Me will be loved by My Father. I also will love him and will reveal Myself to him. If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. The one who doesn't love Me will not keep My words. | John 14:21, 23-24

**You show your love for Christ through obedience**. Lack of obedience is an indication that you don't love Him as you should. Though your obedience may fall short of perfect, God looks at your heart. In those matters where you clearly know His will, do you choose to obey Him?

*How would you evaluate your love for Christ?* 

1. I deeply love my Savior, and I choose to obey Him.
2. I say I love Him with my lips, but my obedience says I don't love Him.
3. I need to grow in both my obedience and my love.
4. Other: ____________________

**Sometimes obedience to Christ will be costly**. As your love for Christ grows, the capacity for sacrificial obedience will also grow. Through His obedience Jesus set an example for us to follow. He loved the Father enough to go to the cross in obedience (Philippians 2:8).

> He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death
>  —even to death on a cross. | Philippians 2:8

#### LOVING ONE ANOTHER

> Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the greatest and most important commandment. The second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments. | Matthew 22:37-40

God has given many commands throughout Scripture. Once, when He was asked what the greatest command was, Jesus summed up all the commands by saying we should love God and love our neighbor. 

In the parable of the Vine Jesus gave one special command: 

> This is My command: love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, that someone would lay down his life for his friends | John 15:12-13

Jesus went on the next day to lay down His life for His friends, demonstrating His love. Earlier in the evening Jesus spoke about loving one another when He said…

> By this all people will know that you are My disciples, 
>  if you have love for one another | John 13:35

In the weeks to come, I want to help you obey these commands. You will learn to love others by praying for them. As you fellowship with believers and witness to the world, you will learn to show God's love by meeting needs. In a variety of ministries you will demonstrate love to those inside and outside the fellowship of believers. Abiding in Christ will strengthen you for this kind of love. 

## Application

This week find ways you can abide in Christ and develop a deeper devotion to him. 

If you don’t have a quiet time already. Start reading Psalm 119, break it up a section at a time. Meditate on that section. Read it a couple of times, think about it, what jumps out you? Why did it jump out at you? Share with other believers what the Lord spoke to you or showed you. 

Try to just spend 15 minutes with the Lord to start out. 5 minutes of reading, 5 minutes of meditation and 5 minutes of prayer. 

You don’t have to have an elaborate study, but you need to start somewhere. Spark the devotion in your heart and then fan the flames and let them grow. 

Work to develop a more intimate quiet time and relationship. 

Get alone with your Heavenly Father sometime this week. Choose a quiet place where you are not likely to be interrupted. If the weather and your health permit, go to a favorite place outside. Spend at least half an hour (more if you can). Take time to talk to Him about all of the things going on in your life. Worship, praise, and thank Him. Take time to enjoy His presence. Be still and know that He is your God. After your moments with the Father, write a few words below describing what you felt and thought. If you sense that He spoke to you;  write that down, too.
