# Employee Handbook

## First Baptist Church of Corsicana

### About This Employee Handbook

We have prepared this handbook as a general statement of our policy and as a guide for general information that should assist you during your employment. The provisions of this handbook are designed to serve as guidelines rather than as  absolute rules, and exceptions may be made from time to time on the basis of particular circumstances.

This employee handbook does not constitute a contract for employment with First Baptist Church either expressed or implied. Employment at First Baptist Church is at-will.

The statements contained in this handbook do not limit the right of either this organization or the employee to terminate the employee’s employment or compensation, with or without cause or notice, at any time. Further, this organization reserves the right at any time to change, delete, or add to any of the provisions or benefits in its sole discretion.

This employee handbook supersedes all prior oral or written policies and guidelines.

If you have executed an employment contract with First Baptist Church, this handbook is intended to accompany and complement that contract. However, if a discrepancy exists between this employee handbook and the employment contract, the language of the employment contract controls.

### Attendance Guidelines

Regular attendance and punctuality are considered essential functions of every employee’s job. Therefore, all employees are expected to arrive on time, ready to work, every day. Our philosophy is that absenteeism is generally controllable. Therefore, absence control is best achieved through individual treatment aimed at the irresponsible, chronic absentee.

We define an absence as failure to report for and remain at work as scheduled. This includes arriving late for work and leaving early without prior supervisory approval. Additionally, absences that exceed the permitted number of hours under the vacation and sick plan may be considered unexcused absences.

If you are unable to arrive at work on time, or must be absent for any portion of the day, you must contact your supervisor as soon as possible. If possible, you should speak directly with your supervisor. If that is not possible, then you must leave a message for your supervisor. Since each department has different needs and internal procedures,  employees must check with their supervisor to determine any additional or specific instructions for reporting absences or tardies.

Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. The standard of what is excessive is determined by the needs of your particular department. 

Nothing in this policy shall affect the at-will status of all employees, nor shall it restrict, constrain, or prohibit managers from applying discipline for other actions. For example, if an employee is late and, upon receiving a warning, responds disrespectfully, the employee may receive additional discipline for insubordination or a negative attitude, up to and including immediate termination. This organization will administer this policy in accordance with federal and state law,  including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act.

disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination of employment and/or legal action.
