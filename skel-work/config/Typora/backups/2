**Explain the meaning of the Lord’s Supper.**

“…the Lord’s Supper is the commemoration and proclamation of His death until He comes, and should be always preceded by self examination (But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. | 1 Corinthians 11.28). 

The purpose of eating the bread and drinking from the cup is to actively *remember* what Christ has accomplished for us through His death and to *proclaim* the sufficiency of His death to save sinners until He returns.

Partaking in the Lord’s Supper is both a corporate and a personal exercise. It is a corporate exercise in the sense that we are eating and drinking *together*, as one body, eating from “one bread” ([1 Corinthians 10:17](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Cor 10.17)[![Open in Logos Bible Software (if available)](http://www.logos.com/images/Corporate/LibronixLink_dark.png)](libronixdls:keylink|ref=[en]bible:1Cor10.17|res=LLS:ESV)), for we are trusting in a common Savior.

At the same time, the Lord’s Supper is an individual exercise in the sense that each individual is responsible for the manner in which he partakes in the ordinance.

> 23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; 24 and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 25 In the same way *He took* the cup also after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink *it*, in remembrance of Me.” 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes. | 1 Corinthians 11.23-26

**Clearly define who the ordinance is for.**

Jesus did not give this ordinance to the world. He gave it to His disciples; to those who have repented of their sins and have truly trusted in Him and in His death for salvation, joyfully accepting the fact that God’s salvation comes by God’s grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. If you are not a disciple of Christ, then you should not participate in the Lord’s Supper.

The Lord’s Supper is for genuine followers of Christ who have repented of their sins (and are still repenting!) and have trusted in Christ alone for salvation. 

**Share the Gospel.**

During the last Passover meal before His crucifixion, Jesus did not merely proclaim the fact of his sacrificial death, but also proclaimed the benefits of it for His people. 

**Confess Sin and Give Thanks** 

The Lord’s Supper is not for the purpose of *being or becoming worthy* to eat and drink – it is about preparing the heart to proclaim the fact that the Lord Jesus is worthy of our praise, our faith, our passion and our confession, because he has died for our sins and purchased our redemption through his death. We don’t confess our sins to be worthy for Jesus; we confess our sins because He is worthy of us. Examination doesn’t make us worthy. Jesus does.

We should eat and drink *as an expression of* our confession and our repentance. We eat and drink in remembrance of Him.

**Eat and Drink in remembrance of Him.**

Eat the bread to remember that Christ gave himself up for us.

> And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body, *which is given for you*. Do this in remembrance of me.’ | Luke 22.19

Prayer

Drink from the cup to remember that Jesus’ blood was shed for the forgiveness of our sins.

> And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, ‘This cup that is *poured out for you is the new covenant* in my blood.’ | Luke 22:20 

Prayer

By eating and drinking the church proclaims that not only do they believe in the death of Christ, but that they are trusting in Christ as the one that their souls so desperately need. Like food nourishes the physical body; in the Lord’s Supper the members of the church proclaim that Jesus is the only nourishment that will satisfy their souls.
