## Introduction

Three weeks ago, Danny spoke of a unifying TRUTH.

- For a Christian everything starts with that *foundational* truth—Jesus is Lord.

Two weeks ago, Logan spoke of a unifying SPIRIT.

- We need to be filled & *transformed* by the Holy Spirit.

Last week, Ashley spoke of a unifying DEVOTION.

- A love for Christ will move us to *know* Christ; And spend time in God's Word.

Today, I will speak of a unifying ROLE.

- God has uniquely formed or shaped you (UNIFYING ROLE) to serve Him.

Let's look at the scriptures. Paul wrote to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 12)…

> 18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. 19 If they were all one member, where would the body be? 20 But now there are many members, but one body. | 1 Corinthians 12.18-20 (NASB)
>
> 18 Ahora bien, Dios ha colocado a cada uno de los miembros en el cuerpo según le agradó. 19 Y si todos fueran un solo miembro, ¿qué sería del cuerpo? 20 Sin embargo, hay muchos miembros, pero un solo cuerpo. | 1 Corintios 12:18-20 (NBLA)

*What does this say?*

It says, each of us is a part of the body. Together we are many parts. Each one of us is unique. I'm not like you, and you're not like me. If we were all the same, then we wouldn't be a body. God made each of us in a way that he decided was best for the body. You are the way you are because that's the way God wanted you to be. I am the way I am because that's the way God wanted me to be. It's God's plan. 

God brings us together in the context of a church so that each of us can serve in a unique ROLE. 

**What happens if we don't do our part?**

The body doesn't function like it should. It's ineffective or unproductive.

*This is important*. If I don't do my part; and if you don't do your part; then we won't be able to accomplish our unifying CALL (share the gospel of Jesus Christ). And if we don't accomplish our unifying CALL, then we won't have a reason for unifying CELEBRATION.

**Why don't we do our part? Why don't we find our role?**

We remain children spiritually—immature. 

- We haven't established the foundational TRUTH that Jesus *really is* Lord in our life. 
- We haven't let the SPIRIT transform our lives. Our minds our set on worldly things.
- We haven't developed a real DEVOTION towards Christ; we don't spend time in God's Word.

If you love someone, you **will** make sacrifices for them and serve them.

*Are you frustrated in your service/ministry?*

- Maybe you are working **alone**; other people aren't doing their part.
- Maybe you are doing **someone else's** job. Seek to find what God wants you to do.

When we commit ourselves to doing the job God made us to do; we will find success (fruit) and fulfillment (peace/joy).

**How did God make you?**

The Bible says God knew you before you were born. He made you to serve Him.

There’s nobody else like you in the world. If you don’t do the ministry God planned for you, nobody else will do it.

Maybe you don't like the way God made you. You might say, "I want to be different. I want to do something else."

That is wrong. Romans 9 asks, "Does the clay have the right to ask the potter why he shaped it the way he did?" No.

Don't question God and say, “Why didn’t you make me different? Why didn’t you give me…this ability, or… that ability. 

Why can't I be taller, thinner,or  better looking.” God made us in a special way. He’s given each one of us a specific purpose. 

**What is your specific purpose in the body of Christ?**

I'm going to ask you to think about five things. This will help you know how you might serve in the body of Christ.

## Five Things That Describe You

### S. Spiritual Gifts

The first thing is **spiritual gifts**. A spiritual gift is a special ability, given by the Spirit to every believer.

The Bible talks about spiritual gifts in Romans, 1 Corinthians, 1 Peter and some might say Ephesians.

**What have I been gifted to do?**

We're going to look at 1 Corinthians 12, where Paul says…

> Now there are varieties of gifts [grace-endowments], but the same Spirit | 1 Corinthians 12.4 (NASB)
>
> Ahora bien, hay diversidad de dones, pero el Espíritu es el mismo. (NBLA)

This says there are varieties (different kinds) of gifts

The Spirit gives each of us different gifts. 

> Each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that. | 1 Corinthians 7:7 (NASB)
>
> No obstante, cada cual ha recibido de Dios su propio don, unos de una manera y otros de otra. (NBLA)

The apostle Paul probably had three spiritual gifts:

- Preaching—the ability to publicly communicate God's Word in an inspired way.
- Apostleship—the ability to start new churches. Literally, it means one who is sent out.
- Teaching—the ability to clearly instruct and communicate knowledge.

I believe that God has granted me the gifts of service, discernment, and administration. 

**A few things should be said about spiritual gifts.** 

- Gifts should be a benefit to the body of Christ. 
- Our gifts don't make us superior to others.
- A spiritual gift is not the same thing as fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5.22-23). 
  All believers should manifest the fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience…)
- It is pointless to use spiritual gifts without love. 
  This is why Paul talks about love in the chapter 13 following chapter 12.

### H. Heart/Passion

The second thing is **heart**. We all have certain passions and interests that motivate us. 
When you feel deeply about something, that's your heart or passion. 

Isn’t it true that there are some things you love to do and there’s just some things you hate to do? 

God wants your ministry to be a blessing, not a burden. 
Why would God have you serve in a place that He hasn’t given you a heart for?

**What do I love to do?**

Another way to ask this question…Who do I like to help? OR What would I like to see changed?

Paul tells us where his heart is. 

> I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was *already* named, so that I would not build on another man’s foundation. | Romans 15:20 (NASB)
>
> me esforcé en anunciar el evangelio, no donde Cristo ya era conocido, para no edificar sobre el fundamento de otro. (NBLA)

Paul wants to build from scratch. He doesn't want to go into areas where someone else has already established churches. 

Also, we know that Paul felt called to go and minister to the Gentiles. 

I love to help people and I love to solve problems. I also love to mow lawns. 

*What do you love to do?*

### A. Abilities

The third thing is **abilities**. We have natural talents and skills which are different from our spiritual gifts. 

God gives people the abilities that they have. Again, he has a plan. It's not something for us to boast about. 

**What natural skills do I have?**

Some people are artistic, some people are musical, some people are mechanical or technical. 

We know that Paul was a tent maker. He could work with his hands. 

We also know that Paul was a great debater…

> And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks. | Acts 18.4 (NASB)
>
> Y discutía en la sinagoga todos los días de reposo, tratando de persuadir a judíos y a griegos. (NBLA)

Paul used his mind to counter false teachings. He had that ability. 

When people have trouble with computers many times I can help. God gave me technical skills. 

God gave Hector mechanical skills. God wants us to use them for Him.

So ask yourself—What talent and skills do I have or have I learned? 

Everyone has skills that can be used in the church. 

### P. Personality

The fourth thing is **personality**. We are all very different. God loves variety. We’ve got different temperaments. 

- Some people take charge. They love to tell people what to do.
- Some people love to have fun. They want every day to be a party.
- Some people are steady and calm. They are dependable and good workers.
- Some people are detail oriented. They are good at fixing things or figuring out problems.

What about Paul? We know he was a zealous man—maybe fanatical. He liked to take charge and lead the way. 

We are all wired differently. So we need to ask ourselves…

**Where does my personality best suit me to serve?**

Do you like work alone or with others? 

Do you like routine or do you need variety? 

When you try to do things that don't really fit your personality, it causes stress. For me it's preaching on Sunday morning. 

I would rather be in the background and fix all the technical issues.

If you are quite or shy, you probably don't want to be a greeter (welcome team). 

If you hate to read or study, you don't want to be a Sunday School teacher. 

### E. Experiences

The fifth thing is **experience**. We have all had life experiences related to education, work, and/or ministry.

When we talk about experiences, we are not just talking about the good things that have happened to us. 

Many of us have had a lot of bad experiences; painful experiences. 

Why does God put us through that? Well, God uses the good and the bad. 
He will use your painful experiences to bring comfort to others. 

**What experiences have I had?**

The book of Acts tells us about Paul’s education experiences…

> I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today. | Acts 22.3 (NASB)
>
> Yo soy judío, nacido en Tarso de Cilicia, pero criado en esta ciudad, educado bajo Gamaliel en estricta conformidad a la ley de nuestros padres, siendo tan celoso de Dios como todos ustedes lo son hoy. (NBLA)

Gamaliel was the top Jewish teacher in those days. I guess it would be like studying with C.S. Lewis or some other great Bible scholar. 

Paul also had some transformational spiritual experiences. He tells us about…

- ​	Watching Stephen stoned (Acts 7:54–8:1)
- ​	a conversion on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1–20)
- ​	and a Special vision from God (2 Corinthians 12:2–7)

Paul faced many external experiences that were painful… 

- thrown in prison many times
- five times whipped and given thirty-nine lashes by the Jews; 
- once he was stoned. 
- shipwrecks, floods, robbers, dangers in the wild

These experiences shaped Paul's life, just as your experiences shape yours.

One experience in my life that had a real impact on me. 

When I was a child, a man came to my home, picked me up and took me to the store to buy me some shoes. 
He bought me a pair of school shoes and a pair of church shoes. 

To this day, that still touches me so much. Just a random act of kindness. Sharing the love of Christ. 

You should know that this church needs you. We cannot fulfill God's purpose for this church in this community unless each one of us does his part—fulfills his ROLE.

## Conclusion

**I know**. Here we are at the end and you don't know what to do. Well, I can't say that I know exactly what God wants each of you to do, but I do know that he wants you to do something. I know that if you are a Christ follower, he has given you spiritual gifts, a heart, natural abilities, a personality and life experiences, just so you can serve Him. He made you for this.

**Satan**. wants you to walk out and do nothing. Don't do that. Right now where you sit, talk to God. Tell him you will commit to fulfilling your ROLE in this church. Think about these five questions and find your place. 

Look, you can contact me this week (jeff@fbccorsicana.org), or use the button on the website. I will help you to find a place to serve. 

**Now**. This message has been focused on the ministry of believers in this church. 

**But**. Maybe you have another decision to make. We invite you to make that decision today. Danny will be down front to receive you.
