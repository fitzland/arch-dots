Fitzhugh Class (@NAME)

This past Sunday we had a great start to the Book of Romans. I appreciate the input and great discussion. To review, we went over the introduction to the book (Romans 1.1-17). You might reflect this week on some of the key concepts.

What is obedience of faith?

What is the righteousness of God?

Why is Paul under obligation?

How is Paul set apart for the gospel?

### Study Guides

If you got a study guide, I hope you'll be able to spend a little time this week working through it. If you did not get a study guide there are plenty more available. I have also attached daily discipleship guide can be a good resource also. 

### Breakfast this Week

This Sunday we'll have breakfast. It will be a pot-luck extravaganza. That means bring something if you can. If you can't, don't sweat it. We'll just be glad to see you. Angie will bring a keto-friendly dish. 

### Church Picnic

Also, don't forget we will have a church-wide picnic at Fullerton-Garrity Park following the 11:00 am service on November 15. A southern gospel group will perform in concert.
