### Regular Bible Study

How much time are you spending with the One who created you, who loves you, and who cares for you? Regular Bible study is essential to your spiritual health. Once a week is not enough, *but it’s a start*.

We invite you to be a part of a small group Bible study. Our small groups are a great way to study God’s Word and encourage one another through prayer and fellowship.

> Bible Study begins @ 9:15 am

We have classes for all ages on Sunday. Other small group Bible studies occur at various times through out the year.

### First Time Visitors

We have guest parking on the south side of the church (W Collin St).

When you first arrive, please make your way to our Welcome Center which faces the south (W Collin St). Our nursery is nearby and our greeters can help you find a Bible study class.
