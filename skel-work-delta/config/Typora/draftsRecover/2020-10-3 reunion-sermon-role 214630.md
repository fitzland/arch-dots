## Introduction

Three weeks ago, Danny spoke of a unifying TRUTH.

- that Jesus is Lord. For a Christian everything starts with that *foundational* truth.

Two weeks ago, Logan spoke of a unifying SPIRIT.

- our need to be filled & *transformed* by the Spirit. When we live in the Spirit, old things pass away as we become new.

Last week, Ashley spoke of a unifying DEVOTION.

- A love for Christ will move us to *know* Christ; And we get to know him more by spending time in God's Word.

Today, I will speak of a unifying ROLE.

- Basically, this message is about service. Each one of us is part of the body of Christ. And, as a part of the body of Christ, we have a function or a purpose or a job. What is your function? What is your purpose? What is your job?

Today, I hope to help you find *your* place in the body of Christ.

Let's look at the scriptures. Paul wrote to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 12)…

> 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body. ESV

*What does this say?*

It says, each of us is a part. Together we are many parts. Each one of us is unique. I'm not like you, and you're not like me. If we were all the same, then we wouldn't be a body. God made each of us in a way that he decided was best for the body. You are the way you are because that's the way God wanted you to be. I am the way I am because that's the way God wanted me to be. It's God's plan. 

God brings us together in the context of a church so that each of us can serve in a unique ROLE. 

*Now, what happens if we don't do our part or fulfill our role?*

The body of Christ doesn't function like it should. It's sick or unhealthy. It's ineffective or unproductive.

*This is important*. If we don't do our part; If we don't fulfill our ROLE; If we can't be unified in the body working together, then we won't be able to accomplish our unifying CALL. And if we don't accomplish our unifying CALL, then we won't have a reason for unifying CELEBRATION.

**Why don't we do our part? Why don't we find our role?**

Mostly, I think it's immaturity. We remain children spiritually.

- We haven't established the foundational TRUTH that Jesus *really is* Lord in our life. 
- We haven't let the SPIRIT do real work in our lives. Our minds our set on worldly things.
- We haven't developed a real DEVOTION towards Christ; therefore we don't *know* Christ. *And, we don't know how much He loves us*.

When you really love someone, you **will** serve them. When you really love someone, you **will** make *sacrifices* for them.

*Maybe we are doing a part, but we find ourselves frustrated.*

- we may be frustrated because we are working **alone**; other people aren't doing their part.
- we may be frustrated because we are doing the **wrong part**; we are doing someone else's job.

When we commit ourselves to doing our job; the job God intends for us to do; the job God made us to do; we will find success (fruit) and fulfillment (peace | joy).

So, here are some problems we have in the church.

1. Some people are lazy. They don't want to serve. 
2. Some people want to help but they don't know what to do.
3. Some people are helping, but I think they're doing the wrong thing. 
4. We haven't helped people find their place. To become aware of who God made them to be and what God wants them to do.

If we take account of *who* we are, and *how* God made us, we will be *much* more effective.

I believe, that what God made me to be determines what he intends for me to do. God has a plan for each of us. I have found that when I serve in a way that is consistent with how God's designed me, I'm am much more effective and fulfilled. 

I just don't think God would give us particular talents, temperaments, spiritual gifts, and all sorts of life experiences and then not use them! God has a plan. God formed you for a particular reason (or ROLE).

### How did God make me?

The Bible says in your mother’s womb, God has been molding and shaping you for ministry. And, God knew everything about you even before you were born. 

> Nothing about me is hidden from you! I was secretly woven together deep in the earth below, but with your own eyes you saw my body being formed. Even before I was born, you had written in your book everything I would do. | Psalm 139.15–16 (CEV)

Here's another thing—There’s nobody else like you in the world. If you don’t do the ministry God planned for you, nobody else will do it—because God made you unique. 

You might say: Hey I don't like the way God made me. I want to be different. I want to do something else.

Don't do that, because Romans 9 says:

> Who do you think you are to question God? Does the clay have the right to ask the potter why he shaped it the way he did? Doesn’t a potter have the right to make a fancy bowl and a plain bowl out of the same lump of clay?” | Romans 9.20–21 (CEV)
>

We shouldn't question God by saying, “Why didn’t you make me different? Why didn’t you give me…this ability, or… that ability. Why couldn't I be taller, thinner, better looking…whatever.” God made us in a special way, and the gifts, abilities and background He’s given each one of us has a specific purpose and intent. What God made you to be should inform the ROLE or ministry you’re to have. 

**What I do follows who I am.**

What are the things that determine who I am? There are five things that *shape* who you are. I'm using the word SHAPE as an acrostic today. I didn't come up with this, but I like it, and it helps me when I think about my role and how I might serve the body of Christ. Let's ask ourselves some questions about our shape.

## What is your SHAPE?

**Your ROLE or ministry is determined by your SHAPE.**

### S. Spiritual Gifts

The first letter in the acrostic is S. And, it stands for **spiritual gifts**. A spiritual gift is a special ability, give by the Spirit to every believer.

So the first question we want to look is “What have I been gifted to do?” You will or should have looked at this question in your Bible study today. You can find lists of the spiritual gifts in Romans, 1 Corinthians, 1 Peter and some might say Ephesians.

**What have I been gifted to do?**

We're going to look at 1 Corinthians 12, where Paul says…

> 4 Now there are varieties of gifts [grace-endowments], but the same Spirit; 5 and there are varieties of service [ministry], but the same Lord; 6 and there are varieties of activities [workings or operation], but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. 7 To each is given the manifestation [coming to light] of the Spirit for the common good. ESV

What does this say? In simple terms it says that…

- there are different KINDS of gifts, 
- there are different TYPES of service,
- and we each OPERATE differently.

Paul says the Spirit gives each of us different gifts. 

> God has given different gifts to each of us. | 1 Corinthians 7:7 (CEV)

If we look at the apostle Paul, we might say that he had three spiritual gifts:

He was a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. Maybe he had other gifts.

> My work is to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. | 2 Timothy 1:11 (CEV)

- Preaching—the ability to publicly communicate God's Word in an inspired way.
- Apostleship—the ability to start new churches. Literally, it means one who is sent out.
- Teaching—the ability to clearly instruct and communicate knowledge.

In my own life, I believe that God has granted me the gifts of service, discernment, and administration. 

A couple of things that should be said about spiritual gifts. 

- They are meant to be a benefit to the body of Christ. 
- Our gifts don't make us superior to others. It doesn't work that way.
- A spiritual gift is not the same thing as fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5.22-23). We won't all have the same spiritual gifts, but we all should manifest the fruit of the Spirit. 
- Trying to use my gifts without love is pointless. 1 Corinthians 13 follows 1 Corinthians 12.

### H. Heart

The second letter in the acrostic is H. And, it stands for **heart**. Each of us has certain passions, interests and inclinations that motivate us. When you instinctively feel deeply about something, that's your heart. 

> God is working in you to make you willing and able to obey him. | Philippians 2:13 (CEV)

The question you want to ask here is, "What do I love to do? What am I passionate about?"

Isn’t it true that there are some things you love to do and there’s just some things you hate to do? Where did you get that natural inclination? God put it in you. God wants your ministry to be a blessing, not a burden. So it’s a legitimate question to ask yourself, "What do I love to do? What do I have a passion for more than anything else? Why would God give you a ministry that He hasn’t given you a heart for?"

**What do I love to do?**

You might ask yourself—What do I like to do? OR Who do I like to help? OR What would I like to see changed?

Paul tells us where his heart is. He writes it out in several verses:

> But I have always tried to preach where people have never heard about Christ. I am like a builder who doesn’t build on anyone else’s foundation. | Romans 15:20 (CEV)

There are two things that I notice. First, Paul wants to build from scratch. He doesn't want to go into areas where someone else has already established churches. He wants to go where there are no churches at all. Also, we know that Paul felt called to go and minister to the Gentiles. He says…

> I don’t care what happens to me, as long as I finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do. | Acts 20.24

For me, I love to help people and I love to solve problems. I also love to mow lawns. These are some of my passions.

So two questions might be—What am I gifted to do? AND What do I love to do?

### A. Abilities

The third letter in the acrostic is A. And, it stands for **abilities**. Natural talents and vocational skills which are different from our spiritual gifts. I think Paul might have been referring to these when he said…

> We can each do different things. Yet the same God works in all of us. | 1 Corinthians 12:6 (CEV)

God gives people the abilities that they have. Again, he has a plan. It's not something for us to boast about. 

**What natural skills do I have?**

> We don’t have the right to claim that we have done anything on our own. God gives us what it takes to do all that we do. | 2 Corinthians 3:5 (CEV)

Paul had abilities. When Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla, he found out they were tent makers and…

> Paul was a tent maker too. So he stayed with them, and they worked together. | Acts 18:3 (CEV)

Also, it seems like Paul was a great debater because it goes on to say…

> He spoke to Jews and Gentiles and tried to win them over. | Acts 18.4 (CEV)

Paul had the ability to work with his hands—he made tents. I'm sure of you work with your hands. You're good at fixing things. Who gave you that ability? What do you think God wants you to do with that? He wants to use that in ministry. 

Also, Paul used his brilliant mind, to counter false teachings. He had that ability—to think fast. 

Sometimes, I'll here someone say to me—I can't make this computer do what it's supposed to do. Well, for me it will. I have technical skills that God gave. He wants me to use them for Him.

You might say—I don't think I have any skills that can be used in the church. Well, that's just not true. Or in the words of Lord Business from the Lego Movie—What a bunch of hippy, dippy, baloney. 

So ask yourself—What talent and skills do I have or have I learned? 

### P. Personality

The fourth letter in the acrostic is P. And, it stands for **personality**. We’re all very different. God loves variety. We’ve got different personalities and temperaments. 

You've probably taken a personality test before. 

- Maybe you're a Lion or an Otter or a Golden Retriever or a Beaver.
- You may be an ESFJ or an ISTJ or an ESTP or even a rare INFJ. 
- You may be a Type 6 or a Type 7 or a Type 9.

What was Paul’s personality? In Galatians he says…

> You know how I used to live as a Jew. I was cruel to God’s church and even tried to destroy it. I was a much better Jew than anyone else my own age, and I obeyed every law that our ancestors had given us. | Galatians 1:13–14 (CEV)

These verses talk about Paul’s personality. He said was a zealous man—fanatical. He was likely a Type A personality. If I was guessing, I'd say he was a Lion and he was probably an extrovert. 

We are all wired differently. So we need to ask ourselves—Where does my personality best suit me to serve?

**Where does my personality best suit me to serve?**

Are you introverted or extroverted? Do you like serving alone or with others? Do you thrive in the routine or do you need variety? These are all things that you should consider when you think about your ROLE. When you try to do things that don't really fit your personality, it causes stress. For me it's preaching on Sunday morning. 

And I would bet, that if we put Danny up in the booth to take care of all the little tech issues that occur on any given Sunday, it would cause him stress. Right?

If you are an introverted person, you probably don't want to get involved with our Greeters Ministry. 

If you hate to read or study, you probably don't want to be a Sunday School teacher. 

### E. Experiences

The fifth letter in the acrostic is E. And, it stands for **experience**. Here we are identifying our live experiences related to education, work, and/or ministry.

When we talk about experiences, we might be thinking about all the wonderful things that have happened to us over our lives. But there's something else to think about. Many of us have had a lot of bad experiences; painful experiences. 

We often wonder—Why did God put me through that? Well, God uses the good and the bad. He wants to use all of your experiences to bring wisdom and comfort to others. In recovery, they say that God doesn't waste a hurt.

**What experiences have I had?**

So now, I'll say that your experiences should help determine the direction you move toward in ministry. 

Related to Paul’s education experiences, it says in Acts…

> I am a Jew, born and raised in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I was a student of Gamaliel and was taught to follow every single law of our ancestors. | Acts 22.3 (CEV)

Gamaliel was the top Jewish teacher in those days. I guess it would be like studying with C.S. Lewis or some other great Bible scholar. 

We already mentioned that Paul was a skilled tent maker. His work experience included working with his hands.

Paul also had some transformational spiritual experiences. He tells us about…

- ​	Watching Stephen stoned (Acts 7:54–8:1)
- ​	a conversion on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1–20)
- ​	a long three years maturing (Galatians 1:18)
- ​	and a Special vision from God (2 Corinthians 12:2–7)

And obviously, over his life he had many, many ministry experiences—just read the book of Acts. 

Paul faced many external experiences that were painful… 

- thrown in prison many times
- near death often 
- five times whipped and given thirty-nine lashes by the Jews; 
- once he was stoned. 
- shipwrecks, floods, robbers, dangers in the wild

These experiences shaped Paul's life, just as your experiences shape yours.

I have shared this before, but one experience in my own life had a real impact. When I was a child, a man (Carey Ford) came to my house, picked me up and took me to the store to buy me some shoes. He bought me a pair of school shoes and a pair of church shoes. 

To this day, that still touches me so much. Just a random act of kindness. Sharing the love of Christ. 

You should know that this church needs you. We cannot fulfill God's purpose for this church in this community unless each one of us does his part—fulfills his ROLE.

## Conclusion

I know. Here we are at the end and you don't know what to do. Well, I can't say that I know exactly what God wants each of you to do, but I do know that he wants you to do something. I know that if you are a Christ follower, he has given you spiritual gifts, a heart, natural abilities, a personality and life experiences, just so you can serve Him. He made you for this.

Satan wants you to walk out and do nothing. Don't do that. Right now where you sit, talk to God. Tell him you will commit to fulfilling your ROLE in this church. Think about these five questions and find your place.
